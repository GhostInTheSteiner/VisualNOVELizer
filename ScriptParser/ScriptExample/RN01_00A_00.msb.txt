Someone once said that this is a battle to save the world.
Someone once said that the hope of all mankind restson our shoulders.
But—
I don't care about any of that stuff.
This is just to satisfy my own impulses.
I mean, getting to fight your greatest rival, and in a situation like this? It really gets your blood pumping, doesn't it?
I couldn't care less if people think I'm some amoral asshole. I don't mince words.
The only thing I care about is beating the number one player in the worldand taking their spot on the top of the leaderboard.
“Is there anything you want to do after that?” you may ask.
Nope. There's nothing. Nothing at all.
But despite that—
Or rather, because of that, I have to do it.
After all...
I'm no hero.
I'm no soldier.
I'm not the protagonist of some mecha anime, either.
“System Link: online.”
“Mic test: Kai, say something.”
“Ojarimouse. Nocchiyo.”
“L-Loud and clear.”
“Everyone, say something!”
“Testing, testing.”
“Ah...! Osu!”
“I-I feel like I'm becoming one with everyone. An auspicious wind is blowing, and with it is coming—”
“Yup, okay!”
“Kai, is your PokeCom plugged in? It's the red cable.”
“Way ahead of you.”
“By the way, why red? Got a new favorite color or something, Aki-chan?”
“Because it makes it go three times faster!”
“OS, s-s-system boot complete. Tera stable.”
“Can you see my face?”
“Nice and clear.”
“All servomotors: less than 1% error from home position.”
“Um, electric supply systems: normal. It says the power generator can run continuously for 13 hours.”
“More than enough time.”
“Actuators all green. Gyro sensor, auto balancer: both functioning correctly.”
“Skip checks from number 9 to number 16.”
“Wait, are you sure?”
“Can you just trust me for once? Who do you think I am?”
“Aaah, forgive me, oh young one.”
“All right, next, activate ‘DG297’!”
“Activated.”
“Left and right laser scanners: all green.”
“Now loading perimeter map...”
“3 meters... 5 meters... 7 meters... 10 meters... 15 meters... 20 meters... Maximum range!”
“T-T-Topographical assessment AI functioning properly. No problem. Everything's fine.”
“Camera test time. Go nuts.”
“Testing 360-degree camera!”
“Kai, did you fasten your seat belt?”
“Of course.”
“Seat lock released. I just have to spin around, right?”
“Camera link confirming... Damn, I'm getting dizzy.”
“I-I confirmed it on the monitor, too.”
“C-Coordinate anchor on standby. Okay?”
“Just a sec...”
“Adjustments complete. Go ahead.”
“L-Le coordinate anchor has arrived!”
“Would you mind not using such weird expressions?”
“B-But I refuse!”
“Okay, okay, no fighting.”
“All right, all checks complete.”
“And now for today's weather report, February 28th, 2020.”
“Er, Airi?!”
“Tanegashima and Yakushima, Kagoshima Prefecture: northeast winds. Mildly strong south winds expected later today. Clear skies.”
“Wave height: 1.5 meters. Air temperature: high of 14 degrees Celsius, low of 10 degrees Celsius. Chance of precipitation: 10%.”
“That's all for today's weather report.”
“I appreciate the valuable information.”
“No problem!”
“...That's everyone in the Robotics Club, right?”
“I at least wanted to do a walking test, if possible.”
“But since we didn't have time for that, we're going into this unrehearsed. You still up for this?”
“Please. We knew that was the case from the start.”
“Don't go and call things off now.”
“...”
“Condition, all green! The final call is a GO!”
“Kai... Let's come back together. No matter what.”
“Phew...”
“Now then. This is where my game starts...!”
After all...
I'm no hero.
I'm no soldier.
I'm not the protagonist of some mecha anime, either.
I'm just a fighting game player.
“Gunvarrel, launch!”
