Airi: “I'm desperately longing.”
Airi: “Longing for the wintry sky.”
Airi: “For the chilly winds.”
Airi: “For the powdery snow that descends and melts.”
Airi: “I'm desperately waiting.”
Airi: “This is ‘my’ dream.”
Airi: “But having it snow isn't enough.”
Airi: “It snows here too.”
Airi: “That snow might be special in and ofitself, but it's not super special.”
Airi: “I want it to be like a miracle.”
Airi: “For example...”
Airi: “A Christmas Eve blanketed in white,powdery snow.”
Airi: “Snow feels so much more romantic whenit falls on that specific day, doesn't it?”
Airi: “Some people say that it simplymarks a date on a calendar.”
Airi: “But ‘I’ believe that dates are important.”
Airi: “For a long, long time,people have applied meaning to their days.”
Airi: “Each day with its own purpose.”
Airi: “And out of the 365 days that form a year, peoplehave given special meaning to certain specific days.”
Airi: “So that they can celebrate those days joyfully.So they can make precious memories with loved ones.”
Airi: “Those days serve as something to work towardfor the year. To be excited for.”
Airi: “Those days serve as something to work towardfor the next year. To be excited for.”
Airi: “‘My’ body could fall apart at any moment.I think it would be better if I disappeared, but...”
Airi: “I'd like to try and last until Christmas Eve.”
Airi: “It's the one day that I love more than ‘my own’ birthday.”
Airi: “Experiencing a white Christmas Eve in a placewhere snow rarely falls would be a true miracle.”
Airi: “‘I’ still believe in that miracle, and so every year,I check the weather forecast a week ahead of time.”
Airi: “Oh, weather forecast...”
Airi: “Will it snow this year on December 24th?”
Airi: “Can you make this one dayout of the year extra special?”
Airi: “I'm desperately longing.”
Airi: “Longing for the wintry sky.”
Airi: “For the chilly winds.”
Airi: “For the powdery snow that descends and melts.”
