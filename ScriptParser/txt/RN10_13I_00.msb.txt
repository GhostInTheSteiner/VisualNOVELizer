Back and forth...
Back and forth...
The floor beneath me sways back and forth in an unchanging rhythm.
The sound of waves faintly reaches my ears.
In this dark, narrow room.
I put on a black bodysuit.
Like some kind of membrane, it's thin and elastic.
It tightly clings to my bare skin.
The cool feeling is pleasant.
Then, upon realizing that my body feels hot, I bite my lip.
It seems like, without me being conscious of it, I'm excited.
Back and forth...
The floor sways.
The world shakes.
Outside the small window is a sea of blue with no land in sight.
???: “Wyvern. The operation begins in 90 minutes.”
???: “Begin preparations.”
Misaki: “Understood.”
I by no means expected that I'd receive Wyvern as a call sign.
It was surely intentional.
The same call sign was used in a certain mecha anime, long ago.
For a ghost that doesn't exist.
For a phantom with no substance.
Perhaps it's surprisingly fitting.
I hold my streamline helmet under my arm and open the watertight door of the room.
I walk through a narrow, confined passageway, heading toward the hangar.
Exiting onto a catwalk, I look down at the giant black spider sitting below me, currently on standby.
Misaki: “I would prefer it... if it was white...”
Back and forth...
The world shakes again.
The waves are tall today.
But that proves no obstacle to me.
