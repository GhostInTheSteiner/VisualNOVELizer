Even the ever present aurora that eerily stains the entire night sky is barely visible due to the red lights.
Kaito: “...”
It's already late into the night when I look out the window from the back seat of the police car.
Workers continue to go in and out of the ruins that were once Kimijima Kou's home.
In the end, after a lot of thinking, I decided to report the whole story to the police.
In fact, up until a moment ago, I was being questioned in the back of this police car. It took forever.
The cold sleep device can't just be removed.
If they carelessly cut the power, they risk killing Yukifune Airi.
Even then, I just couldn't leave her be.
I asked the police to prioritize Yukifune Airi's well-being and to thaw her out in a proper facility somewhere.
Although I have no idea if they'll listen to my request. I was just the first person to discover her.
The police officer who questioned me, Miyamasu-san, said that they understood. I'll trust them for now.
I considered telling them about the Kimijima Reports, but they seemed busy enough as it is, so I kept quiet.
And then eventually, I was let go.
I'll leave the rest to the police.
If nothing else, this is better than if I were to try and handle things myself.
I probably shouldn't dig any deeper into this.
I might talk to Airi like she's my pal...
But she's not Yukifune Airi.
We're total strangers who have never met before.
This isn't my business. No one would benefit from me poking my nose where I don't belong.
If she continues her long sleep, we'll probably never speak to one another.
And if she does wake up, I have nothing to offer her. No way of filling the nine year void in her heart.
As the person who found her, this is all I can do for her.
Miyamasu-san offered to drive me home, but I have my scooter, so I declined.
Also...
According to the clock, it's almost eleven at night.
I only have an hour until AR Airi vanishes.
I call home to tell them that I'm taking a bit of a detour, then hop onto my scooter.
