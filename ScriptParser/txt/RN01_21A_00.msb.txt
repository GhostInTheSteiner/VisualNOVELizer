Akiho: “Mmnggghhhh...”
Akiho is face down on her desk, groaning.
She's holding the Honorary Prez's giant manual.
I'm guessing she's been reading it all morning, ignoring class.
The Prez's programming is all printed and organized in the operation manual. That's Misa-nee for you.
Akiho has a dejected look on her face while she flips through the notebook.
Akiho: “There's no way I'm gonna be able to rewrite the programming in just a day...”
Akiho declares her surrender in the empty classroom after the day's exams.
Akiho: “Even though your idea is super awesome, Kai...”
Kaito: “Welp, I guess there's no point in going to Tokyo.”
Now that that's all settled, it's time to eat.
I stuff my cheeks with the curry bread I bought earlier in the day.
Akiho: “I'm not giving up just yet! As long as we enter, we still have a chance of winning, even if it's just 1%!”
Kaito: “...”
Kaito: “I knew you'd say that. Seriously, your unwillingness to ever give up is a special kind of annoying... It's a real nuisance.”
Akiho: “But...”
Kaito: “If you enter ROBO-ONE like this, you're just gonna embarrass yourself.”
Akiho: “Kai...”
Akiho quickly stands up and faces me.
Akiho: “You said yesterday that you'd be the operator, didn't you...?”
She firmly grabs both of my shoulders and clings to me as tears begin to form.
Akiho: “Didn't you?!”
Kaito: “You're forgetting that I had a condition...”
Akiho: “But you were so kind yesterday, Kai!”
Kaito: “To keep you from throwing a tantrum.”
Akiho: “If you at all care about the Robotics Club...”
Kaito: “I don't.”
Akiho: “Not even a little?!”
Kaito: “If you want me to listen to you, either beat me in a match, or honor my condition. One or the other.”
Akiho: “Tch!”
Akiho hastily whips out her PokeCom.
Akiho: “I just have to win once, right? We have 36 hours until ROBO-ONE. You're not going anywhere, pal! Ready?!”
So, that's her strategy...?
Of course, the gap between our abilities is wider than the Amazon River, but it's possible that after a bunch of matches, I could make a mistake and she'll get lucky.
There are no absolutes in fighting games, after all.
Kaito: “Alright, that's fine. Just don't blame me if I crush your spirit, Aki-chan.”
Akiho: “Uuugh... can't you show me just a little mercy...?”
I quickly finish my curry bread, then thoroughly wipe my hands with a wet wipe.
Kaito: “Let's get rolling. Or do you wanna do this somewhere else?”
Akiho: “We'll start here.”
Akiho's pretty worked up...
I grin and pull out my PokeCom.
Kaito: “Hm...?”
Akiho: “What's up?”
A message? Who's it from? Curious, I open it...
FRAUKOUJIRO
こんな亀レスで大丈夫か? 昨日のUMISHO氏の話、かなり面白そうだったんで、
こっちでちょいちょいっとプログラム作ってみたわけだが。うpしとくから試

sry for the necropost. what u said yesterday was rly interesting, so I tried whipping together a program for u, UMISHO-shi. I upped it already, so try it out. Gevanni did it in a night. 2ez. w8, who the hell is Gevanni? lololol anyway, tbh I don't really talk to ppl like this, but consider it an apology for treating u like a cheater. btw, I may or may not hav a thing to discuss with u, so I might contact u again. gimme your thoughts on the program I sent too. anyway, below you'll find the app required to use the program, and a list of parts you're gonna have to dump into your hobby robot. it ain't gonna be cheap, so you'll have to front the cash lolololol.








Kaito: “...”
Wait, wait! What the hell?!
The message is filled with all sorts of bizarre terms I don't recognize, but I still somehow manage to get the gist of what's written.
Akiho: “Kai?”
Kaito: “We might be able to... implement the Kill-Ballad control system into the Prez...”
Akiho: “Wha?”
Kaito: “Aki-chan, can you get these parts?”
I show Akiho the parts list at the end of the message.
Akiho: “Er, hmm... I dunno... I'm sure the Robot Clinic could have them all, but I'll have to ask if they're in stock right now.”
Akiho: “H-Hey, who sent you this message?”
Kaito: “KB's creator. I took a shot in the dark and asked for the source code, but they sent me a whole program instead.”
Akiho: “Wh-Whoa...!”
Akiho: “The wind's blowing our way! This new plot twist's getting me fired up!”
Akiho is so excited that it's genuinely hard to believe she was just clinging to me in tears.
Even I never expected such a convenient turn of events to go down like this.
It's a little hard for me to be too happy, though. Who knows what Frau Koujiro has in store for me...?
