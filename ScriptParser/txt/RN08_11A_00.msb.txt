The next day.
Today's a holiday, so we've got the day off. I set out bright and early in the morning. Yesterday was a busy one.
I checked the Cosmo Resort and the Masuda Tracking and Communication Center for the AR annotation, but no luck.
I have until midnight.
Because it's possible that Airi disappears when the date changes, that's my deadline.
If I don't somehow find Report No. 6 before then, I'm screwed.
And worst case scenario, I'll have to give up on Report No. 7 completely.
Airi: “It will be nice and clear today, with a 0% chance of precipitation.”
Airi: “It'll be cold, so put something warm on when going out.”
Airi faces the wrong direction even though she's seemingly talking to me.
Yesterday... No, not just yesterday. Lately, I've stopped trying to think about Airi's words and actions.
If Airi somehow survives past tomorrow, I'll handle it.
But it's probably just a bug.
Or at least, that's what I keep telling myself.
Even if I stick my neck into all of this, I won't be able to get answers within the day.
The Kimijima Report takes priority right now.
I've narrowed the search down to five locations. I should do the rounds.
I guess I'll use deluoode map to pick out potential spots.
