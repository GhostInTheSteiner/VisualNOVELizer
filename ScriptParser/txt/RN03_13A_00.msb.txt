Akiho: “Ah, you're back.”
Kaito: “Huh? What are you doing here, Aki-chan?”
Akiho is standing in front of my house.
For a second there I thought I accidentally went to the Senomiya's, but no, this is definitely my house.
After the club activities ended, we'd gone home together and parted ways before sunset.
Kaito: “If you gotta ask my folks for something, you should've just gone in.”
There's light shining through the windows.
I don't know if Dad is home, but Mom is for sure.
Akiho: “No, it's nothing like that.”
Akiho: “I just noticed the light wasn't on in your room.”
Akiho: “I dropped in and saw you weren't home, so I was about to head back. But you just happened to show up, so...”
Kaito: “Wanna come in? If you haven't eaten yet, you can grab something here. Though I have no clue what's on the menu today.”
Akiho: “It's fine, really. That's not why I visited.”
Kaito: “Oh, okay.”
While I park my scooter in the garage, Akiho silently kicks stones at her feet.
Does she want to talk about something?
If that was the case, she could've just hit me up on Twipo or given me a call.
Kaito: “So? Did you come here to announce that you're dissolving the Robotics Club or something?”
Akiho: “O-Of course not.”
Kaito: “Then what? Is it about Misa-nee appearing on TV?”
Akiho: “...”
Kaito: “Bull's-eye, huh?”
Akiho: “Hehe, how'd you know? Are you a mind reader now?”
Kaito: “You're just too easy to figure out.”
Akiho: “She was really on TV, huh?”
Kaito: “Yup. And she cried.”
Akiho: “She sure did.”
Kaito: “Did she contact you?”
Akiho: “Nope.”
Kaito: “Did you try to contact her?”
Akiho: “Nope.”
Kaito: “I see.”
Akiho: “Should I?”
Kaito: “You could at least send her a message. I doubt she'll respond, but...”
Akiho: “I guess.”
Akiho: “Yeah, okay. I'll try sending one.”
Did she really come all this way just to get my approval?
Akiho: “I was watching the news and thinking.”
Akiho: “Just about how far she is from here.”
Kaito: “It's another world.”
Akiho: “Right?”
Akiho: “...”
Akiho goes silent again.
If she was in her usual high spirits...
Akiho: “I'll show those reporter jerks what's what for making Big Sis cry! My Gunvarrel Super Duper Punch'll do them in!”
She'd probably say something like that.
Akiho: “Yeah, um, that's all.”
Akiho: “I'm going home.”
Kaito: “Is that really all you wanted to say?”
Akiho: “Hehe, it's only a two-minute walk, right? No biggie.”
I guess not.
But she still could've just called.
Akiho: “Oh, right.”
Akiho: “Summer break starts tomorrow, but club activities are still on, got it?”
Kaito: “Tomorrow's a Saturday.”
Akiho: “The Robotics Club cares not! If you're not awake in the morning, I'm coming for you.”
Akiho: “Have a good niiight.”
Akiho lightly waves her hand and walks away. I smile bitterly as I see her off.
Kaito: “Good grief, you sure do love Misa-nee, don't you?”
Akiho: “You got that right!”
I can only hear Akiho's voice coming from further down the dark street.
