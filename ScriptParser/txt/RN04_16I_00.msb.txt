Through the monitor is another world.
Within the screen is an azure sky, unseen in Tokyo.
But no matter how much I stretch my hand toward it, I can't reach it.
Misaki: “...”
The image is displayed on my PokeCom.
In it, I see a sight that brings me back in time.
I gaze at it absentmindedly.
In the center of the image...
...There's a large bipedal robot standing hunched over a little.
GunBuild Project Prototype Model-1.
It's a crude design, with no sense of power behind it.
I designed it when I was in high school.
Misaki: “I see... So, it's finally complete.”
The image was attached to a message that Aki and Kai sent me a few days ago.
I've been so busy that I didn't have a chance to look at it until now.
Judging by Aki's text, she's really excited.
I never thought it'd end up differing from Gunvarrel so much. High school me would be shocked.
Sawada: “What's that?”
Misaki: “...!”
The sudden voice surprises me.
Without my having noticed, my boss, Sawada, is standing behind me.
He's looking down at my PokeCom with cold eyes that make me think of a reptile of some kind.
Misaki: “I didn't know you were back, Section Chief.”
Misaki: “If you'd told me prior, I would have prepared coffee for you.”
Sawada: “That's unnecessary. I just came to retrieve something I forgot.”
Sawada: “So?”
Sawada is pushing me to explain the image on the screen.
I return my eyes to the PokeCom.
I scoff.
Misaki: “It's nothing, just junk.”
A ghost from nine years ago.
It's actually a mystery as to how it ended up so ugly.
It's completely different from what I designed.
I sigh a little and turn the screen off without any particularly strong feelings one way or the other.
