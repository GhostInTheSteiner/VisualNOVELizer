I'm back in Odaiba, but I don't feel like heading over to Akiho yet.
On the way to the Arena, I gaze out at the flow of cars from a bridge above the highway.
Kaito: “Sister Centipede, you there?”
Kaito: “...Sister Centipede?”
Weird. She always responds when I call her.
I boot up ‘IRUO.’ on my PokeCom.
As far as I can tell, there's no sign of her anywhere.
She's still linked to my PokeCom.
Which means, she should be able to appear here, not just on Tanegashima.
If nothing else, I know she was with me at least two days before I left.
Kaito: “Helloooo? Sister Centipede?”
I call out to her again, but she still doesn't respond.
This has never happened before.
Did they do more maintenance? Did she get erased?
With the Kimijima Reports public, it's possible that the Committee of 300 may have forced Happiness4U to erase her.
There was a time where having Airi and Sister Centipede around all the time was kind of annoying, but...
Well, now that they're not here anymore, it's kind of lonely.
Kaito: “...”
Kaito: “Guess I'll head back...”
I'm sure Akiho is putting all her heart and soul into assembling Model-2 right about now.
I should help out at least a little bit this time.
I tuck away my PokeCom and head for the Expo Arena.
That reminds me... I wonder if they sell Skal in Tokyo?
I'll swing by a convenience store on the way.
