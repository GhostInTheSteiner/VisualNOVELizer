The metal tower stands high above ground, quietly, yet accurately, transmitting its noise into space.
It's as though it's absorbing the sound from its surroundings, converting it into the noise it emits.
The chirps of cicadas and crickets.
The flaps of bird wings. Even the sounds of leaping insects.
No matter how carefully one listens, such sounds do not exist here.
The 30-meter radius surrounding the tower resembles a geyser spewing into the depths of hell, where death flows freely through the air.
The grating noise is akin to a scream echoing out from the underworld.
Little Girl: “Verification test in progress.”
In this space filled with the silence of death, a young girl whispers.
Little Girl: “Reporting test #2887.”
Her bare feet produce no sounds with each step she takes. The girl looks up at the sky and whispers to nobody.
Little Girl: “Presently Japan Standard Time, year 2019 A.D, month 6, day 12, hour 18, minute 9.”
She holds a single, pure white feather in her hand.
Little Girl: “No change in status.”
She whispers mechanically, with no sign of emotion.
She shows no sign of minding the noise.
Little Girl: “Report of verification test #2887 complete.”
Just then, the wind blows.
It's strong enough to cause the plants to sway. However...
Neither the girl's hair, nor the edges of her soft clothes, budge an inch.
Only the feather in the girl's hand floats gently into the air.
The pure white feather melts into the dusk-colored sky.
While her gaze follows the feather's path...
The girl, expressionless until then, narrows her eyes in a seemingly pained manner.
She quietly speaks into the wind...
Little Girl: “...Whose eyes are those eyes?”
