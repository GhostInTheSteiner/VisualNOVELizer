Nae: “This is Tennouji.”
Nae: “We've safely secured Chief Senomiya.”
Akiho: “...!”
The command center I'm currently in is eerily silent.
Nae: “We've taken control of the command center. Other than Senomiya Misaki, all terrorists have... committed suicide.”
Akiho: “Huh...?”
We were prepared for a firefight, but in the end, we didn't face a single terrorist on the way here.
Subaru: “Were you able to stop the rocket launch?”
Nae: “I'm sorry...”
Nae: “No matter what we try, it won't accept the abort launch command.”
Akiho: “What...? But why...?”
Nae: “I don't know...”
No matter what we do, it won't listen to our commands.
We asked Chief Senomiya about how to deal with it, and even called the others back at the airport, but no luck.
Kaito: “Isn't there a launch control building for large rockets next to the VAB?”
Kaito: “What about there?”
Ken'ichiro: “It isn't being used for this launch...”
Chief Senomiya holds up his own PokeCom and speaks.
Akiho: “Dad! I'm so glad you're safe...!”
In response to Akiho's words, Chief Senomiya manages to muster a smile.
When we charged in here, he was tied up and gagged.
He was bound like that for the entirety of the last two days, yet he still manages a smile to put his daughter at ease. Dads really are super strong...
Ken'ichiro: “That rocket's launch control system should be the same as Epsilon. Mobile control.”
Ken'ichiro: “But sadly, the guy in charge of that, Fujishiro-kun... Remote access to his PC is currently blocked. We can't access his computer.”
Nae: “The one with current administration is...”
Nae: “Kimijima Kou.”
Akiho: “What?!”
Misaki: “What a fascinating conversation.”
An unfamiliar voice rings out from my PokeCom's speaker.
Is this Senomiya Misaki?!
I glance at Chief Senomiya's face.
He has such a sad look in his eyes...
Misaki: “But now you understand.”
Misaki: “You cannot stop the rocket launch.”
Misaki: “Although I applaud you for neutralizing SUMERAGI.”
Misaki: “This is the end.”
Misaki: “You are out of options.”
Misaki: “Just give up and watch the launch from there.”
Kaito: “...”
The members of the Robotics Club are at a loss for words.
And I have to be the bearer of even worse news...
Nae: “Kaito, Akiho... Everyone in the Robotics Club.”
Nae: “Starting now, you're no longer the decoy team.”
Nae: “You're the only ones who can save the world now.”
Please forgive us adults for not being able to take responsibility... For putting this heavy burden on you all.
Nae: “No matter what you decide to do, I'll follow you to the end...”
Nae: “Nobody will blame you if you choose to—”
Kaito: “Could you stop talking for a sec, Nae-san?”
Nae: “Huh?!”
I'm caught off guard.
Kaito: “Choose to what, run away? Like hell we will!”
Kaito: “I'm here for one reason, and one reason alone. To become the best in the world...!”
Kaito: “There's no way I can hide how fired up I am to finally settle the score with Misa-nee after 7 goddamn years!”
Junna: “Yashio-kun...”
Airi: “...”
Frau: “Duhuhu... I'm getting wet.”
Subaru: “Absolute nonsense... But by and large, I agree.”
Mitsuhiko: “Sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do. That's a pro tip.”
Akiho: “Kai.”
Akiho: “Let's beat her...”
Akiho: “Let's beat Big Sis!”
Kaito: “I wouldn't have it any other way...!”
Aaah, these kids are something else...
They're so strong...
None of them are losing to this insane pressure. They're all fighting while believing in what they all built together.
Nae: “Good luck.”
Ken'ichiro: “Akiho...”
Akiho: “I'm sorry, Dad.”
Akiho: “We might not be able to save Big Sis.”
Ken'ichiro: “Just... be safe.”
Chief Senomiya says as he taps the logout button.
There's nothing else we can do.
All that's left is to believe in the Robotics Club.
Everyone... please, don't lose...!
