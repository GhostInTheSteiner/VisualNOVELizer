Summer break!
The last one of my high school life! My precious, valuable summer break!
A month-and-a-half-long promised paradise!
Or that's what it was supposed to be. Instead I have to come to club.
My dreams of playing Kill-Ballad to my heart's content sink deep into the ocean.
Subaru: “...”
And for some reason, Subaru's in the hangar.
Akiho: “Subaru! You're alive!”
Kaito: “Aki-chan, do you even hear yourself?”
Subaru: “...”
Subaru: “Good morning.”
His greeting is even colder than usual.
He looks bored, sitting on a parasol chair while drinking a can of coffee.
Akiho: “Hey, um, is it... really okay for you to be here?”
Akiho: “Oh, wait! You made peace with your dad?! You must've talked it over, and he allowed you to come to club.”
Subaru: “My dad isn't such a lenient person. Of course he didn't give me permission to be here.”
Akiho: “Wait, then...”
Subaru: “He was extremely upset with me. He forbade me from playing with hobby robots ever again.”
Subaru: “Which is why I came here in secret.”
Kaito: “What're you gonna do if he shows up again?”
Subaru: “It won't be a problem.”
Subaru sadly hides his gaze.
Subaru: “I told him I was leaving to study in quiet, on my own.”
A closer inspection of the table next to him reveals a stack of textbooks and notebooks.
Kaito: “I really doubt that excuse is gonna fly.”
Subaru: “It'll be fine.”
Kaito: “How can you be sure?”
Subaru: “...”
Subaru: “Because I dismantled M45 in front of his very eyes.”
Akiho: “What?”
Subaru: “I had to prove to him that I'd sealed away my interest in hobby robots.”
Subaru: “Which of course means we won't be entering the ROBO-ONE World Championships.”
Subaru: “I'm sorry about that, Yashio-senpai.”
Kaito: “Well, if it means I don't have to become Mr. Hyades, it's kind of a net positive for me.”
Akiho: “Subaru... It must've been so painful to have to take M45 apart like that...”
Akiho looks like she's about to cry.
She slowly walks over to Subaru and gently grasps his hand.
Subaru: “Huh, wha, Pwez...?!”
Akiho: “I get it. I know how painful this is for you, Subaru.”
Akiho: “M45 was like your other self, your partner...”
Akiho: “To have to take him apart with your own hands is too sad...”
Subaru: “...”
Akiho: “So, Subaru...”
Akiho: “How about we go for a run?!”
Subaru: “Excuse me?”
Akiho: “You know, into the setting sun!”
Akiho pulls Subaru by the hand and forces him to stand, then points at the sky beyond the runway.
It's still a totally blue sky.
Subaru: “I-I'm not running.”
Akiho: “Awww...”
Kaito: “Aki-chan, you'll have an attack if you run.”
She always has to sit and watch the others during PE.
Akiho pouts her lips and releases Subaru's hand.
Subaru: “...”
Subaru: “But...”
Subaru: “The other day, when you tried to protect M45...”
Subaru: “Th-Thank you berry much.”
Kaito: “Berry?”
Subaru: “Kh!”
Akiho: “Oh, gosh. I never thought I'd see the day...”
Akiho: “Kai! Subaru's finally opened his heart to us!”
Kaito: “I'm literally standing right here.”
Subaru: “I-I've done nothing of the sort!”
Subaru: “I simply have spare time now that I won't be entering ROBO-ONE, so I thought I'd study here. And while I'm at it...”
Subaru: “I could assist a little with Gunvarrel's construction. Maybe.”
Akiho: “F-For real?!”
Kaito: “Hoh.”
I never expected to hear those words come out of Subaru's mouth, quite frankly.
I guess having his dreams denied by his dad was a pretty big shock.
Akiho: “I was starting to worry that everyone was ignoring GunBuild-1 even though we got all these new members...”
Akiho: “But the time has come! Victory will be ours!”
And so, Akiho's dream moves forward. All's well that ends well.
If Subaru's going to help with building the robot, I can finally give my mind and body to Kill-Ballad.
Talk about some good news to kick off summer break!
