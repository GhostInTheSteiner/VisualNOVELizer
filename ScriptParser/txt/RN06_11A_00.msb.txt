The next day, the three of us have all been fully immersed in our tasks ever since the sun came up. We've been taking full advantage of the holiday.
Having said that, I already finished replacing all of the lights yesterday.
So what have I been doing now that I'm done, you ask?
I've been secretly trying to fix Gojiro-kun's power circuitry by watching and imitating Akiho.
But it's much more difficult to work in the dark storeroom...
Junna finished before nightfall, so Akiho took the circuit board and installed it onto Yoshiro-kun. It was gonna be the second time the thing had opened its eyes, but...
Despite taking notes beforehand, Akiho ended up miswiring the entire thing, and everything went to hell after that.
She lost track of what connected to where, and we ended the day with Akiho on the brink of tears.
