The mist is clearing.
The sky is still dark.
I can just barely make out the blood-red aurora.
Nae: “Reporting in!”
Nae-san comes running into the hangar.
She then calls out to everyone still working there.
Nae: “The rocket has begun moving from the VAB to the launch point!”
Nae: “Estimated launch time is T-minus 8-9 hours!”
Nae-san's report causes everyone to tense up.
This intel must've come from one of the JAXA employees hiding near the TNSC, monitoring the launch site.
All of the JAXA employees aside from Chief Senomiya evacuated here safely, but a few brave souls volunteered to go back to the site for surveillance.
Akiho: “Give us one more hour and we'll be all done!”
Junna: “Um, uh, Akiho-chan, I need more of these screws. Where were the spares again?!”
Subaru: “Furugoori! How's the program coming?!”
Frau: “I-I'm on it right now! W-Worst case scenario, I'll update it while it's walking!”
Mitsuhiko: “Hey! I need about 20 male students to load the laser mount onto the truck!”
There are some people sleeping in the corner of the hangar who were unable to make it through the night.
The older women are feeding all of us hot pork miso soup that they made by borrowing the local joint's kitchen.
Several cranes are gathered here at the airport.
Along with tons of cars parked in front of the hangar with their headlights on in order to supply lighting for the hangar.
It's ridiculously early in the morning.
And yet, the once deserted airport is filled with people.
I know this is kind of an inappropriate time to say this, but it sort of feels like a festival.
Dawn will be here soon.
The final showdown is approaching.
