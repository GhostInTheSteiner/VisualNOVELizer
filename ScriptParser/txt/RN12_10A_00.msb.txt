By the time I get back to the old airport, the sky had begun to brighten.
I've got some time until Super GunBuild-1 deploys, so I head out to the runway.
I spin around in place and take a look up at the sky.
Pretty soon, the morning sun will rise from the city side.
I can't see the sun peeking out from the horizon.
But the winter morning air is as fresh as ever.
Maybe it's because of all that rain last night.
Although it's a little chilly, breathing in the cool air calms my nerves.
I place one hand on my hip and take a drink from a bottle of Fruit Sour Melon.
They don't sell these in Tokyo, so I was only drinking Skal when I was there.
Akiho was happy about it, but I was craving Fruit Sour Melon the entire time.
I chug down the bottle all while thinking to myself that this is kinda like my own personal Last Supper.
It's then that I catch Akiho heading toward me from the hangar.
Akiho: “Kai.”
She waves at me.
Kaito: “Are the preparations complete?”
Akiho: “Almost there.”
Kaito: “I see.”
Akiho: “...”
Kaito: “...”
Silence.
The two of us stare at the eastward sky in complete silence.
Akiho fidgets a little, telling me she must want to say something.
But for whatever reason, she can't seem to put it to words.
I actually had something I wanted to tell her, so I opt to go first.
Kaito: “Aki-chan, here, take this.”
I pulled out the controller for the EM irradiation device.
Akiho: “...”
But Akiho doesn't take it.
Akiho: “If I press this... you'll get an attack, right?”
Kaito: “Yep. That's the idea.”
Akiho: “I can't do that...”
Akiho: “I know better than anyone else how painful your attacks are.”
Kaito: “That's exactly why I'm giving it to you.”
Kaito: “I'm entrusting this to you, and only you, Aki-chan.”
I face her and look directly into her eyes.
Kaito: “Aki-chan. Don't look away.”
Akiho: “Kai...”
Kaito: “When I tell you to press it, you can't hesitate. No matter what.”
Akiho: “But...”
Kaito: “Promise me.”
Kaito: “I need this in order to beat Misa-nee.”
Kaito: “You told me yourself, right? Beat Misa-nee.”
Kaito: “I intend to keep that promise.”
Kaito: “That's why you need to promise me too, Aki-chan. Right here and now.”
Kaito: “Promise that you won't hesitate to press this button.”
Akiho: “Kai...”
Kaito: “Promise me. Please.”
Kaito: “Otherwise, I won't be able to pilot the robot with any sort of peace of mind.”
Akiho: “But you're the one who always says you have zero faith in me...”
Kaito: “Which is exactly why today, I'm putting my faith in you for the very first time.”
Akiho: “...”
Akiho silently takes the controller.
Kaito: “Thanks.”
Akiho: “Hey, Kai...”
Akiho: “Just don't overdo it.”
Akiho: “I know I might not have the right to say this since I'm the one who forced you to pilot the robot, but...”
Akiho: “If... If you were to get hurt, I...”
Akiho: “Or if something even worse happens... I don't...”
Yeah, I know. I know I might die.
I can't bank on Misa-nee taking it easy on me.
The battlefield we're about to head into isn't a playground.
Akiho: “If I lose you...”
Akiho: “I won't be able to handle it...”
Kaito: “C'mon, that isn't the face our president should be making before our final battle!”
Akiho: “I know...”
Akiho rubs her eyes.
I force out a wry smile.
Kaito: “Hey, Aki-chan.”
Kaito: “Got any candy?”
Akiho: “Wha...?”
Kaito: “Candy.”
Akiho: “...”
Akiho: “Geez, Kai...”
Akiho: “Yeah. Just one.”
Akiho smiles and pulls out a Space Candy from her skirt pocket.
Kaito: “Thanks. I'll pay you back later.”
I take it from her.
And our fingers touch.
Kaito: “Oh, and...”
Kaito: “Think I can get a blessing from the goddess of victory?”
Kaito: “You know, like a kiss?”
Akiho: “...”
Kaito: “Aki-chan?”
Akiho: “Oh, ah!”
Akiho: “With me...? Are you sure...?”
Akiho: “Wouldn't you... rather have one from Big Sis...?”
Kaito: “It has to be you, Aki-chan.”
Akiho: “...”
While fidgeting and facing down, Akiho takes one step toward me.
Akiho: “F-Fine... Just this once.”
She looks up at me and closes her eyes.
I can see that her lips are slightly trembling.
She's totally nervous. That's adorable.
...Not that I can talk. My heart's pounding a mile a minute.
I take Akiho's hand.
And our lips meet.
Akiho: “Mm...”
Just a light touch.
The moment our lips touch, I can feel her hand tremble.
But then she squeezes mine in return.
Akiho: “...”
We look at each other.
Akiho: “Tastes like melon...”
She says.
Kaito: “Well, I did have a Fruit Sour Melon earlier.”
Akiho: “Kai...”
Akiho: “I... For the longest time, I...”
Kaito: “Let's save that for after the battle is over.”
Akiho: “Huh...? But that's a total death flag...”
Death flag?
Kaito: “Are you kidding me?”
Kaito: “There's no way in hell I'm gonna lose. Who do you think I am?”
Kaito: “I'm the second best in the world. Number two!”
Akiho: “I know...”
Akiho: “I believe in you.”
And at that moment, the dazzling morning sunlight pierces my eyes.
The sun has risen, marking the beginning of the day of the final battle.
The rain clouds from the night before have vanished.
Today's gonna be nice and sunny.
There's no turning back.
Everything will be decided today.
Akiho: “Kai.”
Akiho: “Take care of Big Sis for me...”
