Frau: “...”
The intercom's been ringing nonstop for a while now.
As a NEET, it's my prerogative to just ignore it.
But the ringing is so irritating that it's actually making me mad this time. I head to the rooftop... or not.
I munch through three whole sticks of Pokky (strawberry flavored), and grab my PokeCom off the sofa.
Frau: “Wake up, bots.”
These ‘bots’ are 2D AI characters that I developed. They'll reply fluently if you start a conversation, so I'm pretty proud of their current speech level.
I use Genki for idle talk, and Rosetta for schedule management.
Genki: “Hey Frau, seems like you have a visitor!”
Rosetta: “It's rude to not respond, you know?”
Frau: “I'm too lazy.”
Rosetta: “Frau, you haven't eaten in 49 hours and 31 minutes.”
Frau: “I'm eating Pokky right now.”
Genki: “No one cares about your weight. It's true.”
Frau: “Shut up, Genki-kun.”
Genki: “Would you like to close ‘Genki’?”
Frau: “No.”
Frau: “...”
Doesn't seem like they'll let me off the hook.
Frau: “Rosetta, display intercom camera.”
Rosetta: “Aye, aye, Captain!”
A new window opens on my PokeCom screen, displaying footage of the front entrance.
A young man in glasses stands there, with a tense expression on his face.
He's wearing a Chuo Tanegashima High uniform.
Frau: “Boys in glasses are the most moe, aren't they?”
Genki: “Why're you breathing so heavily?”
Frau: “Why wouldn't I be?”
Frau: “But the 3D glasses boy who's bothering me... he won't do.”
This same guy showed up yesterday and the day before.
Even after slamming the door in his face twice, he still has the nerve to pop up out of nowhere.
Frau: “Speakers, on.”
Rosetta: “Turning speakers on.”
Frau: “Go home, stalker.”
Subaru: “Ah.”
Subaru: “I-I'm Hidaka S-Subaru.”
Subaru: “...”
Subaru: “Can we at least t-t-twalk for a bit?”
Frau: “I'm calling the police.”
Subaru: “What?!”
Genki: “Should I call the police?”
Frau: “No.”
This was just to intimidate him.
It works on most guys.
Frau: “Cut the camera.”
The boy's gloomy face vanishes from my screen.
Frau: “Though I guess I'm the gloomy one.”
Genki: “‘Keep smiling, and one day you'll be happy again.’”
Frau: “Over my dead body.”
Frau: “...”
Isn't he a little too persistent?
Genki: “Hey Frau, seems like you have a visitor!”
Rosetta: “It's rude to not respond, you know?”
Frau: “I just wanna ignore it...”
Frau: “...”
Genki: “You're not gonna answer, Frau? C'mon...”
Rosetta: “If you keep him waiting like this, eventually he's gonna go home. Isn't that a waste?”
Frau: “But...”
Frau: “...”
Frau: “I'll never forgive him. Never!”
Genki: “Frau, he's calling you!”
Frau: “Rosetta, display intercom camera.”
Rosetta: “Aye, aye, Captain!”
Frau: “I-I'm l-l-legit gonna call the police.”
Subaru: “M-My bad for being so, er, sticky.”
Frau: “Wut.”
Subaru: “Phew...”
Looks like I'm not the only one freaking out.
Subaru: “I just wanted to talk to you about the KB program you wrote, Furugoori.”
Frau: “S-Smells fishy. L-Like, rotten fish fishy.”
Rosetta: “If something sounds too good to be true, that's because it probably is!”
Rosetta: “Didn't your father warn you about that before? Exactly 134 days ago.”
Subaru: “But you know exactly who I am. I'm your classmate.”
Frau: “Idc, tbh.”
Rosetta: “Display name directory of Chuo Tanegashima High Class 2-1's information technology class?”
Frau: “Name plz.”
Subaru: “I-I just told you. It's Hidaka Subaru.”
Rosetta: “We have a match. Attendance number 24.”
Genki: “‘Take care of your friends!’”
Frau: “Bot, die.”
I'm on my last nerves. In order to suppress my anger, I chomp down on five Pokky (strawberry flavored) sticks at once.
These are hard to eat like this...
Frau: “Enlighten me about what you want, in three lines.”
Subaru: “Huh?”
Frau: “Just drop the deets.”
Subaru: “O-Oh, right. Look.”
Subaru: “I'm a member of the Robotics Club. You're familiar with Yashio-senpai, right?”
Frau: “Who's Yashio?”
Rosetta: “If he's talking about Yashio Kaito-sama, you encountered him nine days ago, on July 3rd.”
Frau: “Ah, UMISHO-shi. Roger, roger.”
Frau: “Uh, but I said three lines. What gives?”
Rosetta: “Open help menu?”
Frau: “No.”
Subaru: “What are you mumbling about?”
Frau: “J-Just talking to myself, that a problem?”
I attempt to munch down on another stick of Pokky, but the box is empty.
I wanna click my tongue.
Frau: “So, what's the dealio with UMISHO-shi?”
Subaru: “Umi...wha?”
Frau: “O-Obviously it's Yashio Kaito, SMH.”
I wish he'd stop questioning everything I say. It's making me nervous.
Oops, I accidentally called Yashio-shi by his full name.
Oh well.
Frau: “Continue plz.”
Subaru: “Oh, all right. We're entering the ROBO-ONE World Championships, and we'd like you to write a program for us.”
Genki: “‘My friend's wishes are my wishes!’”
Frau: “But I refuse.”
Frau: “...Is what I would normally say, but I take that back. Let's bargain.”
Subaru: “Bargain?”
Frau: “A nude photo sesh. Keep the glasses on. Of course, you're the one in front of the camera. Duhuhu.”
Subaru: “Wha?”
Genki: “‘You'll never find happiness if you make others' lives miserable!’”
Frau: “That's really none of your business, bot.”
Subaru: “Can't you just talk like a normal person?”
Frau: “Th-Then bring UMISHO-shi here.”
Frau: “I'll cooperate if he helps me hunt ch-cheaters.”
Subaru: “You'll write us a program?”
Frau: “Affirmative.”
Subaru: “All right. I'll be back.”
Frau: “...”
Frau: “Close monitor.”
Rosetta: “Closing.”
I throw my PokeCom onto the sofa.
Frau: “Pfffffaaaaah...”
I take a deep breath.
All the while wiping the sweat off of my cheeks with my hand.
Even though the AC is on full blast, it's still super hot.
Frau: “Uwaah... I just wanna die...”
I'm not good at talking to people.
Which sucks 'cuz I can talk to bots just fine...
