Akiho: “Hahh...”
It takes less than three minutes to walk from Kai's house to mine.
Just as I arrive back at home—
Kai passes by on his scooter honking his horn. He waves at me, so I wave back.
I wonder why?
As I watch his back grow distant, I feel something grow tight, deep inside of my chest.
I suddenly realize that I'm squeezing the little Fink attached to my PokeCom.
I think back on Kai's earlier attitude.
He was going on and on about games.
It didn't seem like he was into Tennouji-san as a woman, but as a fellow gamer.
I recall the past.
I was in grade school, and my sister still lived on the island.
She loved playing games. She was especially into fighting games.
And of course, she always taught me and Kai how to play since we were constantly shadowing her.
But I'm really bad at things that require fast, instantaneous responses, so I never improved.
Kai on the other hand, well, he just kept getting better and better.
And suddenly, before I knew it, he and Big Sis were communicating using dedicated fighting games lingo.
It's a language I've never understood.
It's a raw language that only people who live in that world can understand.
Whenever they'd start talking like that, I'd just space out, alone.
It felt like I was lost in some foreign country all by myself. I was lonely.
It kind of felt like Big Sis was being taken away from me. I was even jealous of Kai.
So whenever the two of them would start rambling about or playing games, I'd watch the anime Dad let me borrow.
That's how I became so knowledgeable about mecha anime.
But I still felt left out.
I'm sure the reason my chest hurts so much right now is because I feel the same as I did back then.
