???: “Senpai...”
???: “Senpai!”
???: “Wake up!”
???: “C'mon!”
Kaito: “Ugh...”
My cheeks sting.
And my body feels heavy.
It's like I'm paralyzed or something.
I think I might be pushing my luck.
I slowly come to.
And open my eyes.
Kaito: “...”
Frau: “Ah, y-you're awake.”
Frau: “Thank goodness...”
Frau: “I'm so glad...”
Kaito: “What are you doing?”
Frau: “I-I was trying to wake you up, Senpai. What of it?”
Kaito: “And why exactly does that involve straddling me?”
Frau: “W-Well, you collapsed after your whole body twitched...”
Frau: “So, of course I thought you were dead. That's just common sense.”
None of that explains why you're straddling me.
Kaito: “I passed out, eh?”
Kaito: “I probably shouldn't have put the pads on my temples.”
Frau: “Y-Yeah, tbh.”
Frau: “But I'm so glad you're okay.”
Frau lazily begins to lean her body atop of mine.
Frau: “I-If you had died, I-I would have killed myself.”
Kaito: “...”
Frau rests her soft body atop of mine.
I haven't been this close to a girl since I was a little kid.
I had assumed Frau's body temp was super low, but I was wrong.
Her warmth seeps into my skin.
It's a reminder that she's alive like I am.
Dammit, here I am imagining Frau naked.
Frau: “A-Are you turned on?”
Kaito: “Nope... Apparently I don't even have the energy for that.”
My exhaustion has reached its limit.
It seems my hunger and tiredness are taking over my libido.
I'm so sleepy.
I wish I'd just fallen asleep after passing out.
Kaito: “By the way, Kona-chan.”
Frau: “Hm...?”
Kaito: “Can you move out of the way?”
Frau: “B-But I refuse.”
Why?
Frau: “Please...”
Frau: “Let me stay like this a little longer.”
Frau: “I have something to tell you.”
Kaito: “But you smell, Kona-chan.”
Frau: “Y-You do too!”
Geez.
What does she want from me?
Frau: “...”
Frau: “Gunvarrel is a v-very important work to me.”
Frau: “It's something that Mama poured all of herself, her emotions, her feelings into.”
Frau: “It doesn't hurt to see people t-trashing Kill-Ballad.”
Frau: “As much as I hate taking a beating, I can deal with it.”
Frau: “But I just can't stand watching Mama or her creation get insulted...”
Frau: “But then the final episode leaked...”
Frau: “And Mama's last message surfaced.”
Frau: “Maguyan set me up to look like a terrorist, and now Mama's being treated like a criminal, too.”
Frau: “It's all falling apart...”
Frau: “Mama and Gunvarrel... Their memories are being tarnished.”
Frau: “Senpai...”
Frau: “D-Do you think Gunvarrel can shine once again?”
Frau: “After all the bullying, all the awful name calling...”
Frau: “I'm sure lots of people have quit being fans.”
Frau: “But even then, do you think I can make Gunvarrel shine again?”
Kaito: “I don't know.”
Frau: “...”
Kaito: “At the very least, I don't think it'll ever reach the heights that it did back during its heyday.”
Kaito: “But...”
Kaito: “There's nothing wrong with starting from the ground up and working at it, little by little.”
Kaito: “Let's see... For example, how about we start by bringing Model-2 to the Expo.”
Frau: “The Robotics Club's robot...?”
Kaito: “It is modeled after Gunvarrel, after all.”
Kaito: “So, help us out. We've wanted you to to join us for ages.”
Kaito: “You can start there and keep at it until the day people realize that your mom was right.”
Kaito: “And for what it's worth, I believe that she was.”
Considering the myriad of parallels with the Kimijima Reports, I can't just write it off as a conspiracy theory anymore.
Frau: “Okay.”
Frau: “I-I said earlier that moving here was pointless.”
Frau: “But that's not true.”
Frau: “...”
Frau: “Because I was able to meet you, Senpai.”
Frau: “I'm glad I came to this island.”
Kaito: “Well, it's not like I've done anything for you, Kona-chan.”
Frau: “In my industry, neglect play is a type of reward.”
What industry is she talking about?
Frau: “Just show me your collarbone.”
Kaito: “How about no? You're way too direct sometimes, Kona-chan.”
Kaito: “Pheeeew...”
I take a deep breath.
Then lightly push Frau away and sit up.
Kaito: “Break time's over. We've got a time limit to deal with.”
Frau: “Win, Yashio-senpai.”
Frau: “You don't have to win for me or Mama.”
Frau: “Just don't lose to that cheating piece of shit CPU.”
Kaito: “You got it.”
That was always the plan.
