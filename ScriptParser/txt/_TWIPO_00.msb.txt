Because he was a spoiled brat
Watched the Gunvarrel OP: COURAGE ACQUIRED!!!
I wonder if VP is in today?
Ugh! She's not!
Gonna go to tea time with Yamada-sensei, the Japanese teacher
Whaaaat I wanted to play KB but there's an update...
VP didn't come. Didn't see her today either...
@UMISHO You at the club room?
Gonna go to club room! Storm and surge! Blast of Spirit!!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Was that the Red Comet?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Was that the Blue Comet?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Was that the Yellow Curry?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Yamada is a nice guy
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Not Skal huh
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You get treated by Yamada too much. You guys are basically tea-drinking buddies
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Good work
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Why don't you give up?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Maybe send a letter?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I am
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I dunno
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you wanna know let's have a match
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You don't have enough patience
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I can picture you actually screaming
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Is that another anime line?
Ah, dang. My work clothes were in the club room. Oh well
Maintenance start!
Is This Youth?
Break time
@UMISHO You rarely get the reference! You have improved♪
@UMISHO That's Layziner. And it's “Azure” not “Blue”
@UMISHO How did you get curry out of that?!
@UMISHO Not yet! Not until I get the funds!
@UMISHO I already tried. No response...
@UMISHO It's Genki-kun's punchline in Gunvarrel!
LONSOW is already open~!!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Its good that you still have energy. I couldn't do it and fell asleep
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I would've loved to stay a kid 4ever
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If its KB I can pull an all-nighter
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Was there an anime like that? I still don't know. Total coincidence
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I would ask for an explanation, but nvm
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Is that another Gunbam?
Started watching Faibird again and got hooked and watched 10 eps. Look at the time!
Good morning. Sooo sleepy
20min morning matches. 3-0
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I told you not to stay up late. Gotta follow that rule
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I won't say “Don't you regret it” cuz I understand. I forget time when im stuck on KB
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Go study
@UMISHO Yeah, sorry. But you too!
@UMISHO You seriously don't get tired of KB...
@UMISHO You, a goody two-shoes?!
Mitchie taught me some useless trivia. White hairs grow from other places than your head too...
VP isn't here today either
Played 5min. 1-0
OHNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Did you step in dog poop?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Forgot to buy Skal?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Forgot the club room key?
PrinceX is so cute! The design taste is good that even though it's a giant robot, I think it's cute. Expected from the world-renowned TAYOTA! It would be amazing if we can put this electric engine in GunBuild-1! Maybe I can ask in a letter if they'll let me borrow it for free
I wanna eat takoyaki
Why is VP always out?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Wanna go buy some? I'll help you eat them
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Gonna get fat
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Aren't you supposed to eat those on cold days
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON That go for broke mentality is amazing, you really don't know fear
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I thought it was more ugly than cute
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Can't you just put in an electric car engine to solve the problem?
@UMISHO Thanks♪ Hehe♪
@UMISHO Now we know that you have no taste
@UMISHO Hrmm... Maybe I'll ask Old Man Kamata
@UMISHO I'm glad I finished homework in time! I still do have a place to go back to... And nothing could make me happier!
I got too hyped and watched ep. 24 of Gunvarrel this morning
It's raining...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Meet at the bus station
@UMISHO Roger!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm glad you got better grades than me. You are worthy Ms. Club President. Even if they weren't much better
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I was thinkin this from before, but you should stop watching mecha anime while you study
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON A place to go back to? What are you talkin about?
@UMISHO That means we are alike!
@UMISHO You know, while studying, it actually helps. My energy level goes up
@UMISHO You don't get it... I'll show you next time
Played 15min on break. 1-1
Today I gotta go pick up parts from Doc. I have to go on the Thunder Emperor again...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You prolly know, but you should take medicine for motion sickness
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Why don't you get dropped off since it's raining? Ah, on second thought, Mitchie isn't the attentive type
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Maybe dont? Take it easy
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Ah, it's a parody of some mecha anime line. Dunno which anime, but it def sounds like one
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you are gonna explain, can you do it in under 10 seconds verbally?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON No, thank you
...I'm not gonna lose
No way I'm losing!!! Justice will prevail!
I'm hungry. 5th and 6th periods are hell
On my way to Doc's place!
Mitchie's driving is rough... Gonna hurl before I get to Robot Clinic
Played 1 hour. 13-1
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I can't fight on an empty stomach
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Not possible
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You should go to sleep early today. Right now, ur too excited. Might get a bloody nose. Sleep on it, think about it tmrw
@UMISHO Waiting at the bus stop!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Gotcha
Watched GaiGaoGar this morning!!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Feel better after sleeping?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Bet you can live anywhere if you have mecha anime, Aki-chan
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Already that energetic in the morning...
Just noticed that it's bright outside
Played about 10 hours. 108-7
Lost several in a row due to a bad match-up
Sleep time
Good morning. Blast of spirit!
@UMISHO Staying up late again... BAD!!!
Searching through Big Sis's room...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Sorry
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's the natural state of a gamer
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON My situation is a bit better than yours, so it's fine to push myself
It's sunny! Feels GOOD! I wanna go to the beach!
@UMISHO You're not picking up. Still sleeping?
I guess I'll go
Senomiya Akiho, going out!
I'm sooo lonely doing an overhaul at the clubroom on a Sunday
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON For real?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Thinkin about it, haven't gone to the beach in years. Maybe the last time was when Misa-nee was still on the island
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Did you buy a sexy swimsuit? That'd be overdoing it
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't go out by yourself just cuz it's sunny
Cannons...
Finger Vulcan!
Cannons are just for show! The brass doesn't understand things like that!
@UMISHO That's not possible. I went once in junior high. Mizuka-nee took me
@UMISHO Hoho. U wanna see it?
@UMISHO Ah, that's why you came... Thanks
@UMISHO right, let's go to robot clinic
Played around 3 hours. 40-0. Feeling good today
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON “Results”
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Does the Honorary Prez even have fingers in the first place?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't know what that is... Sounds dangerous
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Right. It was the year Mizuka-san came back to the island. I only kinda remember
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Right. You pulled a muscle in the water and almost drowned. I only kinda remember
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Right. I played games on the beach the whole time. I only kinda remember
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON How is the blob of meat on your stomach doing?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's probably some old school swimsuit bought in Nishinoomote, amirite?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Ive seen enough of you in a swimsuit at the school pool
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Fine
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I guess it's my fault too that I didnt pick up the phone
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You owe me one
I wonder if theres a part time job I can make some quick cash with...
Class ended while I was thinkin about something
Gunval Ankh Strikerrrr!
@UMISHO Huh? Where'd you go?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Take off your clothes.
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Construction worker.
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Corpse removal.
Played 20min. 2-1
My stomach isn't doing well this morning...
Maybe I'll ask my uncle in Miyazaki for money for next new year's now...
@UMISHO You ok? Eat something bad last night?
You still get hungry even when you're out of cash. What is life...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I did... But you don't have to worry baaarrrfff
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I did... That's it, for sure
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I did... It might be the key to losing weight...
YEESSSS! Successfully got new year's + allowance early! We are gonna win ROBO-ONE!
Gotta listen to the second OP of Gunvarrel at max volume!
Mom got mad at me...
@UMISHO Don't plan anything after school
Played 10 min. 1-0. matching is slow 2day
Can't wait for after school!
Played 30min. 2-2. Matched with rank 6. HYPE
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Oh, congratz
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Moving quickly ey
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON So, you gave up your free time till graduation. That's pretty amazing
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON calm down. lol
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Uh, I heard it from my house. Of course you're gonna get in trouble if even I can hear it
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Should've listened at Uchugaoka Park instead
Transforming is the definition of romantic idels
Having money is amazing
Played about 3 hours. 28-2
Skal replenishment
Arrived at school. Only the night duty teacher is here
@UMISHO Pick up the phooonnneee
Im bored. Delusion time. ok school transform into a robot nao
@UMISHO I already told you on the phone! Come ASAP! Club President orders!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You should go get checked out
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON That sounds like some delusion a guy would come up with. Or a kid. The clock turned into a face right?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You watched an anime like that recently, huh. Got influenced
Oh man, math is not going well. I don't get any of this at all
@UMISHO me too!
Now, time to practice
I'm getting confused little by little. Maybe its from lack of sleep
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't push yourself
I was able to move the left hand!
Every movement has to be manually controlled. There isn't anything acting as a gyro. Position managing is also done by manpower. Man, Big Sis made something crazy. Insane that she won controlling this. Amazing!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON And yet you still refuse to study. What a badass
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I guess we'll both retake the test in the summer
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Of course, VP will have her eyes on people like us
Ah, I'm getting PUMPED! There's no time for tests!
My test was horrible
Played one hour. 18-0
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Uh, I think you need to take the tests. You're gonna get expelled
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Calm down
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't look around, and act calm during the test. Or they're gonna think ur cheating
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MAX HYPE!
Mitchie, I cant believe it
Mitchie, I cant believe it
It's a totally different game without lag
My win rate is under 50% with no lag
Can't adjust to it
Break time. Played around 3 hours. 20-16. Barely positive
Staring at my phone, wishing it would ring
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON From who, Misa-nee?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON From who, Mitchie?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON From who, me?
@UMISHO He's still out!
@UMISHO How conceited!
@M_NADAFUKADA Mitchie where are you?
All I can do is pray
Got past the preliminaries!
@UMISHO Doesn't Matter: System Unlock!
Wow, I'm gaining a ton of followers!!! What is this?!
I can proudly say that I will get lost in Tokyo
Gonna KB
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't know what you mean. What system?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON What the hell...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I get that your really excited
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON They found you after the preliminary rounds
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON They're probably people who became fans after watching you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Probably cuz you're Misa-nee's sister
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Call me if it's about to get out of hand
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Same. I think you should stay put when that happens
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Mitchie might be lost too
WOOOOOOO!
YAHAAAAAAAAAAAA!
IT'S HEREEEEE!
Mornings are early in Kagoshima
Aah, made it to the island... Nowhere to run...
VP... Isn't off today
Activity limited
I can't lose!!!
Big Sis's dream and memories will fade away. We'll lose what connected us
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't get all worked up. Keep your head up, no matter what
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON The results won't change if you hide
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm sure she's waiting for us
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If it's KB, Im not just the strongest in Tanegashima, but 5th in the world
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Think about the short time we had to prep. We fell right into VP's trap. Doesn't make it your fault
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm not the best since I lost to Pleiades
Subaru got away!
A long journey begins. To TNSC we go!
Ladies and gentlemen, a video compilation containing the complete footage of Mr. Pleiades' amazing victory at ROBO-ONE 41 will soon be available for your viewing pleasure. Details will be announced at a later date, so stay tuned!
Going IN
Kai should have come with me
Am I in the compilation too? Didn't hear anything about this
The chief isn't coming
@Mr_PLEIADES Is this the real Pleiades posting?
@Mr_PLEIADES Regarding the compilation, dont we get performance fees or portrait rights fees or something?
@Mr_PLEIADES Next time ill win
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You're in charge. You should try harder
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Just have a family talk with no one else
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It'd be a waste of time. Whatever the situation, I totally see us at the end being told no
“You're very frank. I don't appreciate it.”
Played 30min. 6-0
But I have money~! We can do it without help from JAXA!
@UMISHO Oh! If it isn't Yashio Kaito, the man who fought me valiantly in the final match of ROBO-ONE 41. Let's have another heated match sometime! However, the winner will once again be me, Mr. Pleiades!

@UMISHO Should've said “Believe in the me that believes in you!” I mean it's not like I expect it from you though
@ROBOT_CLINIC Please wait 1 more month! By then Im supposed to get a good amount of cash. I'll even pay double!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't think it's that easy
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You get to use all that money freely? Are you even allowed to?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON That ain't a good look, Aki-chan lol
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON believe in the me that believes in you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Can you leave me alone if you don't expect it from me?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's my style to cheer from the shadows
I can't use the winnings... So unfair...
I can't pay Doc back!!! Which means all that's left is DEATH!!!
Played 5min. 1-0
@UMISHO Where'd you go? No Club?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I expected this to happen. You got too excited without thinking
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You are far too brave to not pay Doc
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Maybe you should just get a part-time job. at Lonsow maybe
Yesterday, I was feeling down, so I went to Nakatane to look for sponsors and got some donations! I even teared up! YAAAY!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news for you today! Just a few minutes ago, the ROBO-ONE World Championships was announced, and Mr. Pleiades will officially be a part of it!
I will enter the very first World Championships as the Japan representative, as the defending champion. I will not lose! Please support me!
@UMISHO You ditched again~!!!
I just saw on ‘IRUO.’ that the ruined hotel in front of the old airport is under construction? I wonder when this started
Whenever your stuck, it's time to watch Gunvarrel season 3 ep 15!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Hey hey don't be so uptight
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Isn't it fine since I'm kinda like a ghost club member?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you're lonely ask Subaru-kun or Mitchie to keep you company
Appearance is important. I mean it affects how you look in pictures
Getting H Y P E D!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Followed you. It's Yashio Kaito. Nice to meet you
@UMISHO Thanks for the follow. Following back
Played 10min. 2-0
I should've dressed up today. I wish they'd told me earlier
Might be a good change
*errr “Change” ...
*Chance
Ah, I got cleaning duty!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Going on a date or something? You've finally blossomed, Aki-chan. Congrats
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I get it. You were asked for a picture by a shady old man or something. It was just some pervert. Don't talk to them again.
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Is this really you? During club activities you always stay in your uniform doing maintenance, though
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Why are you so excited?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You're back in business, huh
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm glad, though I dunno what u r talkin about
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You're too funny
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You don't like changes?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN errr, what?
Done with interview. Took about 20min...
I had this huge plan that starts with the greatness of Gunvarrel, but I couldn't talk about anyyythinggg. I was soo nervous
Yes! made a deal with Mitchie~. I'm going to meet the CEO tomorrow!
@UMISHO Blossomed? But it's summer right now. Also, it's an interview not a date!
@UMISHO There's nobody like that! If there was, then you'd protect me like a main character in mecha anime would!
@UMISHO I had a newspaper interview! Just now! Isn't it amazing?! Newspaper debut♪ You shoulda been here
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Good luck~. I'll be supporting from home
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Pretty sure he will help you if you butter him up
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Make sure you read the room. Don't push yourself
A... ghost
@UMISHO Kai, where are you? I'm gonna get going
I've been going home by myself a lot lately...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON you are a 3rd yr. you should be fine without a babysitter
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't like it when you go home alone too. Let's meet up first
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Wait for me, I'll be there by 6
Woke up, played 5 hours. 47-1. Guess I'll take a break
Please grant me impact
Ran to Lonsow for some Space Candy
I wanna cry... got a call from a person at a TV station. Thought it was another ROBO-ONE runner-up interview, but it was just a random survey...
Masa-chan won the tournament! Amaging! Good job!
*amazing. How embarrassing...
Space Candy isn't that impactful, is it?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Acting like a celeb already? Kinda cute lol
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Even if it didn't happen this time, being prepared isn't a bad thing
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON There's no reason people should care about us. We're runners-up, not winners
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Hahahah hilarious
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Happens all the time. We all make typos
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You're so innocent, Daitoku-san
It seems like the closed hotel near the old airport is getting fixed up...
Played 5min. 1-0. Off to hangar
Ladies and gentlemen! I am training daily to prepare for the World Championships! Never forget your daily training. If you keep on practicing, you will grow mighty!
Tonight's Dinner: Sauteed Gourd
Until recently, I would go straight home from school to participate in training, but after I graduated, Grandpa said that I didn't have to particapate if I didn't want to. But what am I supposed to do besides training? How does everyone else spend their time after school?
The boys are getting along, playing games. Kinda makes me mad they don't help, but getting along is good
It's a good thing... But I'm lonely!
Participate? Particapate? Which one is right...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Why not go to B-COOP, go fishing, or take a trip to Nishinoomote? I don't know what girls do tho. I just game in the club room
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Don't know what to do? You should come visit the Robotics Club. Maybe if you see me chillin you'll get a better picture of the club
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Didn't you mention something about urban legends the other day? Sounds like it'd be fun to go explore the island, though there isn't much to see
Pile Bunker is so epic
Ugh, I haven't been able to play KB a lot, lately. 3 hours a day doesn't even count as playing
Gonna choke
@UMISHO I go to B-COOP every day. I do the grocery shopping for dinner there. I didn't know there are things you can do besides shopping at B-COOP. I learned something new. Thanks!
@UMISHO Chillin? Lol that is not what I pictured at all. Akiho-chan seems kinda pushy. I thought it was more like a sports clubs. But, you don't seem like the sporty type
@UMISHO I do like urban legends but weird things don't happen in Tanegashima...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Its chill. There r only 3 club members. We have the huge old airport for ourselves too. You can even use it for running. It's about 1500 meters long
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Aki-chan has the sporty-type personality, but nothing else. I'm more secretly sporty, but that's e-sports
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Did you want it to be sporty? I think your more chill than sporty yourself. Well, besides the karate stuff
Tonight's Dinner: Salt-grilled Flying Fish
Squeezed in some time to play 10min. 2-0
@UMISHO Oh, Da—I mean, Master told me the same thing. Hmm, the chill type. Do I look like that?
Ladies and gentlemen! I got more news about ROBO-ONE World Championships! They will be a week long! First to 5 downs loses! They will be fights that clearly showcase athletic skill, but none shall defeat me! I need everyone's support!
I told u, come back when you're craving some pencil/sharpener action! Start with the basics
@FRAUKOUJIRO I want to talk, can you reply?
Ah, got too excited sry
gonna heal by reading Gin-sama's thin-books
Getting anxious... we have to hurry!
But I wanna check out the hobby robots!
WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO GIN-SAMAAAAAAAA
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Think about how I feel having to tag along. Not enough time to play KB
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If youre that interested, team up with him instead of me. I'll let you have it without a challenge
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I think you're cool not drooling over hobby robots. Anyone with your success at ROBO-ONE woulda dived in by now
Geez, feels like I just dug up something troublesome
@FRAUKOUJIRO No reply, huh...
@UMISHO u ok?
Kai was acting weird the whole time in class...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm fine. Thanks for worrying about me
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't think I was weird. If anything, it was withdrawal from not playing KB
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You should just focus on the club
I don't have the courage...
OHHHHMYYYYYYYYYY MMMMMM!!1!
Auctioned items came in. ExFED is amazing. They will deliver even to a desert island. That gets me excited. Duhuhu
Seriously, the InaELE doujins r way 2 pricey! 10,000 yen for 1 is ridiculous. I still bought it tho!
Starting the unboxing ceremony!
HYOOOOOOWOOOOO
KYAAAAAAAAAA IYAAAAAAAAAAA♪
Tera hyperventilating... Huff... huff...
What a dangerous item. The inside is 2 amazing. This must've killed people when it came out
WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
@FRAUKOUJIRO U okay? What was in there?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Calm down
@FRAUKOUJIRO Plz don't pollute my TL...
 Second character balance patch in the works. TBR tweeking Sneijder a bit. The others are a secret
My mind is going a little crazy from thinking about the HUG accident... It is unacceptable and they need to prevent it from happening again. I want ExCo to do full research on it. People getting hurt from robots is too sad...
Played 40min. 9-0. Taking a quick break
I hope Big Sis is ok...
Should I go... What to do...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Nice!
My stomach is starting to hurt... I think. Feels the same as before a match
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON She's tough, I'm sure she's already looking into the accident
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON She should take a vacation and come back to the island for once. Misa-nee is just too busy
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Worrying about it here won't do a thing for her in Tokyo...
Played almost one hour while side-eyeing the club Prez. 12-1
Hungry but gonna live off water cuz I have nothing to wear
New member joined!!! That makes it 4 people!!! HYPE!!!
@FRAUKOUJIRO I can bring Pokky or something. You'll still starve off water
@FRAUKOUJIRO Uh, that's a lie. You have the clothes you wore on the plane
@FRAUKOUJIRO That's why ur staying in? What's wrong with city folk...
@UMISHO Ooo, is this a flag..? Btw I like Pokky. I also like people who give me Pokky
Ladies and gentlemen! Make sure you always say hello! Even if you are strong, if you can't properly greet someone you are no true winner! A promise from Mr. Pleiades!
Since now we have 4 members, maintenance will take 1/4 the time!
What did I do. I joined the club...
I just started watching ROBO-ONE. Can we hurry and get a thin-book for Mr. Pleiades
Since we now have 4 members, attaching the servomotor might get easier
Since we now have 4 members, Mizuka-nee might get mad at all the scooters we park in front of the Irei general store we visit after club activities
Pleiades is a bottom, but I can't pick the right partner 4 him. Maekawa-kyun from the last tournament is 2 much of an ugly bastard
Plus I think I made that younger male student mad. Maybe I shouldn't have joined. Club President looked very happy but maybe I should just say I'm gonna quit. But if I do, then the Club President might get sad...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Welcome! It'll be fun! You don't have to worry about anything! We're happy that you joined!
Since now we have 4 members, we can do a 4 machine combination! But 4 is kind of unsatisfactory. Plus there isn't a famous 4-unit combination robot. If we can get one more, it will reach the aspired 5-unit combination. Let's Combine!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Okay, thanks for today. But uh, Hidaka-kun(?) Looked like he was mad...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN He is always like that~ Don't worry about it!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Welcome. Be sure to give Aki-chan a helping hand
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Consider yourself captured. Take it easy
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN My condolences. Think of it as a time-killer
Wha... The RaiNet book by Koga Yui that ive been searching for is on TabAuc!
Gotta go full force... ! I'll pay 500k. Full Force!
Received a call in TabAuc 24 hr surveillance mode. Is this guy serious
Looks like I joined the club. Rather than that it's all about TabAuc rn
Got more members! WOOO GET HYPED!!!
We can finally Combine Together! Awh, I wish our Cubs combined together. Oh wait, I think Subaru has a YAMANA scooter. So he would be the body part?! Nonetheless I am super happy! Nothing can beat us now!
Only kinda met the 5th member... I wonder if that's ok as club president
Here at school on a Sadurday. I think this is my first time
*Saturday ugh...
Geez, a summoning. Played 2 hours this morning. 24-2. Stopping for now
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Sadurday hehehe
Where is Mageshima Island?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Y-You didn't see anything...
@FRAUKOUJIRO As club president and as an islander, I welcome you! Let's build a robot together!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON But I refuse
Eh...
@GEZI-SISTER Mageshima Island is a deserted island located South of Tanegashima
@GEZI-SISTER Mageshima Island is a deserted island located East of Tanegashima
@GEZI-SISTER Mageshima Island is a deserted island located West of Tanegashima
Been researching on the abnormal weather and encountered something about an “Apocalyptic sound.” My urban legend senses started giggling
*tingling
Ladies and gentlemen! I am planning to enter the ROBO-ONE World Championships with a partner! I treat him as a brother, and I promise he has skill! I will introduce him very soon so keep your eyes open!
Apocalyptic sounds—AKA mystery sounds—signify the end of the world. It was reported heard across the world starting in 2011
Regarding finishing that one job. Because I was concentrated on it, I missed the auction for the RaiNet book by Koga Yui
I will never forgive you. Never!
Places heard: Kiev, Belarus, Florida, Michigen, New Jersey, North Bergen, Maryland, Scandinavia... The list keeps going. Every year the sound is confirmed in new locations
We have more members but GunBuild-1 production isn't going any faster...
The sound itself is uploaded as a video. I got goosebumps listening to it. It was like a scream from a very large animal. Or like the sound of a trumpet that declares the end of the world
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN That might be a dark society trying to conquer space!
Played 20min. 5-0
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I see, sounds interesting. I can goggle it, right? Can't it be heard in Japan?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Chasing urban legends might be a better fit than karate for you. Like a paranormal investigator?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Giggling, eh. I guess it kinda looks like tingling if you stare at for a loonngg time?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you really want help, pay us
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you take the lead convincingly, others fill follow you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Work with Jun-chan. Putting people where they exceed is a required skill for a club president
“This is no Zakku, boy! No Zakku!”
@UMISHO It was first said to be an advertisement for a movie, but there wasn't any movie release related to it for over 1-2 years. And it's still going on in 2019
The theory of it being the “Seven trumpets of apocalypse” written in Revelation was debunked. You hear it more than seven times. I wonder what it really is...
Time to sleep. But before that I gotta watch the Teninu DVD, which is like my sacred book. Gonna get the feels. I get so excited by it my nose starts bleeding. You guys need to watch more 3D. 2D is good too, but 3D has its own good parts
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
@UMISHO I don't have the confidence to beat Subaru...
@UMISHO I mean, I don't know if I am even fit to be club president. I was assigned to it by default
@FRAUKOUJIRO People from Tokyo say strange stuff. Kinda surprising
@FRAUKOUJIRO Congrats, I guess. Your life cycle is way different than most students
@FRAUKOUJIRO Are you eating right? Skin and bones isn't a great look
@FRAUKOUJIRO A random bloody nose means youre working 2 hard. Go see a doctor
@UMISHO When did you discover that only in manga do you get a bloody nose from ero delusions?
@UMISHO Sorry about yesterday
Commuting by bus cuz it's raining
It's leaking...? Call the manufacturers! Gonna make them fix it today! I'll pay a good amount! Only my enemies would soak my PC! Rain is the enemy! Die!
This rain is just a gloom parade...
Been thinking about yesterday. Was karate a dream of mine? Would I want to continue even if dad hit me? Would I want to continue if I had to lie to him? Maybe I just did it from force of rabit...
@UMISHO What is “Alcyone”?
*habit AH I feel like crying
Played 5min. 1-0. Time to go
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't think you need to feel responsible
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You cried too much yesterday, Aki-chan. Though that's kinda normal for you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Wonder what'll happen to the hobby robot
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You continued on even though it was a forced habit, right? I think that has value, regardless if it was your dream or not
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You said you were sad quitting karate. Doesn't that mean something? If you really hated it you wouldn't feel that way
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Before you start talking about dreams, let's start with your typos lol
@GEZI-SISTER The name of a star in the Pleiades star cluster
@GEZI-SISTER The name of a car
@GEZI-SISTER The name of an old mafia boss
@UMISHO Yeah, I didn't have the talent for karate, but I would still get sad and cry when I lost in tournaments. I would also cry on hard training days, but that was me being disappointed in myself...
Huh? Did someone take M45? It's not at the hangar
Played 30min. 5-0
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I didn't see it...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I haven't seen it either
Today's a slutty day. A boy's coming over, duhuhu. What eroge is this? Might just push him down
@FRAUKOUJIRO Die.
Well, uh, I prefer watching 2 boys go at it from the sidelines, but only one boy is coming. Urgggh...
Going to go look for it!
Can't find it. Stolen? No, that's not possible. It's broken. Basically no one knows the real identity of Pleiades. I don't want to think that people on the island stole it. But it is the winning machine... there might be people who would buy it for a high price
@FRAUKOUJIRO Koujiro-san, I don't think you should post things like that...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN It's uncommon to cry due to frustration, which means you took it really seriously. You still think it was a forced habit?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Even a newbie can tell you have no talent for karate. But that doesn't mean it's bad to care
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If you still think it was a forced habit, that's fine. It's not an issue that I should be badgering you about. Oops I got serious, haha lol
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Calm down a bit. Maybe you are overlooking something?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't jump to conclusions
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON There aren't any signs of somebody sneaking around in the hangar, right? The odds of it being stolen are 0%
Guys, I need topics to talk about when alone in a room with a boy. Hurry, I can't help it if something happens!
I'll go ask Frau Bow too
@UMISHO Thanks! I'm calm now. PHEW
@UMISHO I wanted to ask Subaru directly, but maybe I should leave him alone still
@UMISHO Then maybe Subaru took it home?
@UMISHO Also, where are you, Kai? I see ur scooter but don't see you anywhere
@UMISHO Yeah, I shouldn't deny the hard work I put in. Thanks for cheering me up
@FRAUKOUJIRO Uh, good luck!
WOOOO! The Time Has Come! Summer break starts tomorrow! H Y P E!
It's so cold, doesn't feel like I moved to a tropical area. Why is this island cold, huh? But I like it. I like the cold. Hate the heat. sun should just disappear. Sounds poetic but im serious
@UMISHO Why is your name UMISHO?
Summer break...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Cold? Where are you, Frau Bow?
I gotta ask Subaru about M45, it's bugging me
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You're such a kid, Aki-chan. Sometimes you're super boyish
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Depending on what courses you take after high school this may be our last long summer break
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You gotta savor the perks of being a student
@FRAUKOUJIRO Cold in the summer... Was the Koujiro Frau I know a different person? Where is your real body at?
@FRAUKOUJIRO I see. Just your room's in the southern hemisphere
@FRAUKOUJIRO That's the AC. You're gonna catch a cold if you stay in that room
@GEZI-SISTER Because I am an ocean-loving boy
@GEZI-SISTER It's my name read in a different way
@GEZI-SISTER It's from an old manga I used to like
Tonight's Dinner: Croquette
@UMISHO Well, you're still a child!
@UMISHO At the moment, u r the only one that knows how cold my room is. Come get sick with me... Duhuhu, wasn't that kinda dirty?
 Been getting questions regarding the conversion system. As I posted multiple times before, please understand that the benefits from conversions are only cosmectics. Will not affect the stats. Basically an outfit change, get it?
Little brothers are full of emergy since they have a day off tomorrow. They want to stay up late. How come they have so much emergy left
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Emergy \(^o^)/
@FRAUKOUJIRO Energy...
*Energy
Played 'bout 3 hours. 37-4. Had a lot of close losses...
Big Sis's news is uploaded everywhere...
Do you like high school girls (NEETs) that have trashy rooms? I still don't know how to take out the trash. I mean when is a Four Eyes butler gonna knock on my door? Hurry up, can't control what'll happennn!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Want me to clean your room?
Ganging up on her with so many people, making her cry, then uploading it to the world because you think it's funny. It's too cruel!!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You are so nice... Gets me wet
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN But I refuse
GAHH!!! I won't forgive the people who made Big Sis cry!!! I wanna go to Tokyo RIGHT NOW. You big jerks!!!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Oh, sorry...
@FRAUKOUJIRO It's such a mess. Doesn't look like it's only from this month. Way too much junk
@FRAUKOUJIRO Hey, I try to clean up what trash I can whenever I visit. When do I get paid for it?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Whether a butler or a cleaning company, you should get it cleaned even if you have to pay. You got money, you can do it
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Yeah, I saw it too and it made me sick
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's rare to see Misa-nee crying
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON But I still think that it's inevitable that ExCo would get bashed
@UMISHO Ur collecting the tissues I used to blow my nose. Creepy. But I don't mind!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Hey... Don't say things so problematic
Ladies and gentlemen! I hope you are enjoying your summer break! However, be sure to finish your homework first to savor your precious break. A promise from Mr. Pleiades!
I know it's sudden, but I have important news. Today, Mr. Pleiades will be retiring from ROBO-ONE and will no longer be entering any tournaments. Unfortunately, I'll be pulling out from the World Championships as well
To everyone that was supporting me: please forgive my selfish decision, but I cannot fight anymore. ROBO-ONE will keep on moving forward. A new hero will arise. Become the warrior who surpasses me
Alcyone, Electra, Maia, Taygeta, Gerano, Asterope, Merope. By the blessings of the seven goddesses, I arrived from 400 light-years away. I am Mr. Pleiades! Farewell!
I can work on GunBuild-1 all day. There is nothing better
KYAAAAWOOOOOHOOOO!
@FRAUKOUJIO What happened?!
Read hashtag as shota hug -> had a delusion of an adult man hugging a shota -> then got a bloody nose imagining the adult man getting attacked by the shota <- currently here
@MR_PLEIADES Pleiades... Thank you for everything... I promise to the setting sun that I will never forget your brave figure! (Sob)
@UMISHO What is “HUG”?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't think I can do club activities today... Sorry
I feel bad for Subaru-kun...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You really never get tired of it
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Looks like yesterday's indignation has subsided
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't push yourself too much over it
@GEZI-SISTER Helpful Unlimited Gear
@GEZI-SISTER Harmonics Unit Gear
@GEZI-SISTER Hyper Underarmor Gear
It's todayyy! I hope the parts come in fast! Gonna builllddd!!!
Was going to study for college entrance exams... But... Not feeling it. Off to do do Suparinpei to mentally concentrate
The sun-tanned, southern islander boy that I saw this morning going to a store was amazing. If he was wearing glasses I would've gotten a bloody nose! It was meant to be! I'm in paradise, WOOHOOO!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN to do do lol too cute cute
@UMISHO What does the phrase “the time has come” mean?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Please ignore it...
Played 'bout 3 hours. 32-0
@GEZI-SISTER It means now is when what you've been waiting for will happen
@GEZI-SISTER I don't have time for this
@GEZI-SISTER It has something to do with walruses
@UMISHO Thank you for teaching me. I learned a lot♪ I will keep on learning and improving so teach me more♪
Played 15min while I watched them unload. 3-0
What is a “boing-chan”?
Got kidnapped...
@GEZI-SISTER A woman's whose breasts bounce a lot. Kinda old lingo tho
@GEZI-SISTER A baby cat
@GEZI-SISTER A short song or tune
@UMISHO “Boobs,” right?
I had a great offer... But I didn't take it. Uhh, I wonder if I made the wrong move. I feel like I ruled against my gut... Still, I think it's too early to bring in a new unit. GunBuild-1 can still fight!
My role keeps getting bigger and bigger. I'm really afraid that maybe it's not okay for me to be here... People all around me are so talented. I couldn't keep up yesterday either
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I think that people who can make decisions from their values are amazing. You are the club president, you should be proud of your decision
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Thanks! You are an important member too, Jun!!!
Oof, I feel dizzy... Must be because I was pulled out of my room for a long time yesterday. The sunlight is poison to us shut-ins, everyone knows that
I am satisfied watching the nipples on the island surfer boys as they mingle at the beach from the monitor in my room
Ladies and gentlemen! I am here! Remember, at anytime, do not let go of opportunities in front of you! You cannot win unless you do! I always struck upon my opportunities! That is why I am here!
Looks like a lot's going on, but still played 4 hours. 49-1
@GEZI-SISTER Eh?
@GEZI-SISTER Ah, yes
@GEZI-SISTER Yup, that's it!
@FRAUKOUJIRO You alright? Please don't go and die on us. That'd suck
@FRAUKOUJIRO Cuz you stay indoors all the time. It's getting to you
@FRAUKOUJIRO You're totally nocturnal. Like an owl or a bat
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Well, I think the pilot position doesn't need too much knowledge
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You should take a page from Koujiro Frau. Let's both be more bold. You'll feel better after that.
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You are fine, no one there expects you to speak out
Ended club activities early and got home a bit ago. I hope tomorrow is sunny
Tonight's Dinner: Oyako-don
Storm: “Yo!” Tanegashima: “Stop, why are you doing this?!” Storm: “I feel like I want to mess you up!” Tanegashima: “You're gonna just go play with Kyushu after this anyway. I'm just temporary.” Storm: “I-I want to be with you longer, but I'm afraid to hurt your small body...”
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
The wind is too crazy... Dojo is closed today. Thank god I went grocery shopping in the morning
@UMISHO You are worried about me, I understand. So you should bring me things, like a fishburger from WcD
@UMISHO I see... Koujiro-san was passed out the whole time. I will do my best to learn from it. Osu!
The hallway is totally flooded and i keep finding broken glass everywhere. This place really is a shithole. My poor wallet after the repairs is gonna be just as empty as me
@UMISHO I heard from president that it was rough yesterday. I'm glad you're okay...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Are you okay Koujiro-san?
@UMISHO That was reckless of you
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Karate-senpai worried about me... Me likey. Come be my wife. Or my maid, duhuhu
Hey everyone! It is August! When going out, make sure you drink a lot of water! Human are just like robots: you have to do periodic maintenance to keep functioning! A promise from Mr. Pleiades!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Well, you are living in a ruin. Maybe you should move to better place?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Well at least the atmosphere there is cool. Feels kinda like a secret base. I guess Im just a visitor so I don't worry about the practicality
@FRAUKOUJIRO Storms hit here way more often than in Tokyo just fyi
@GEZI-SISTER Nice to meet you, Airi
@UMISHO I get it, u like the atmosphere = u like Frau-tan. I have a lot of empty rooms so u can move in whenevs. But I will charge rent!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Nice to meet you, Akiho♪
Played 2 hours at the club. 15-0. Pace is kinda slow
I have no clothes to go out in. All my clothes are covered in mud from the storm last night
@FRAUKOUJIRO Uh, really? Should I bring Aki-chan's old clothes?
@FRAUKOUJIRO If your clothes are covered in mud, aren't your PCs broken as well?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Basically, you just don't wanna go outside, right?
The fanatic blood in me is boiling from talking about Kagome Kagome
Tennouji-san came by, but she left! Everyone be careful! Don't let her convince you!
@UMISHO What is a “Gunbam”?
@UMISHO It must be hard for people who can't tell a lie when they read one. U r too pure and cute, senpai
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I don't think she is a bad person...
Memo for myself. Tonight's Dinner: Vermicelli
@GEZI-SISTER Something Mitchie likes
@GEZI-SISTER Something Aki-chan likes
@GEZI-SISTER Something Jun-chan likes
Let's all go to the Yoira~Iki Festival together!!
My family was upset when I told them I wasn't going with them to the Yoira~Iki Festival... Should be fine, they don't listen to me anyway, always running around everywhere
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Oh, is that my bad?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON No, not at all!
AHHHHHHHHHHH OOOLLLDDDEEER MMMAAANNN
@FRAUKOUJIRO What happened?! Did a stranger break in?!
I get the feels whenever I watch TigerRabbit. Seriously a masterpiece lol. I wish I watched in real-time
@FRAUKOUJIRO Of course... that's what I thought it was haha...
Quick break. I think I played about 3 hours. 21-4. Not focused at all
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Sure
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON We don't need to all go together. Pretty sure everyone has their own plans
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You're gonna go with no money? It'll be rough when you can't buy any amazing festival food
Fireworks ey. Played 3 hours. 31-2
Festivals hype you up!
op it goes!
*up
@UMISHO Hurry and come to Taiyo-no-Sato. Fireworks are gonna end
op it goes!
I hope Masa-chan and the other two are okay by themselves...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't, it's embarrassinggg
UPPP!!!
“CupTsuba” is going to start a new series next week!!! More thin-books will be coming out!! duhuhu
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
I “love” soccer so much that I watched all the past series while asking myself “What're offsides? Are they tasty?”
@UMISHO What are “fireworks”? I couldn't see them.
Hard Labor!
Played 6 hours. 70-3
@FRAUKOUJIRO My brothers like “CupTsuba” too. I gotta tell them
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Oh k...
@GEZI-SISTER It's a kind of illuminating light
@GEZI-SISTER It's kinda like a bomb
@GEZI-SISTER It's a big, colorful thing that makes a loud sound. It's very pretty
Today's Schedule: Combine the upper and lower half together!
 Released... Check the details on HP
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Want to combine to the lower half? Prez is a tera slut lol
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
Something came. Played 2 hours. 17-0
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Good luck~
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Oh really~
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Finally~
@UMISHO What is “Space Candy”?
Gaydar is going off!!! My heart is going crazy! This shaking beat! This burning HEAT!!!
I saw some muscular men at the old airport from my windowwwww. I wanna go see rn but've got no clothes to wear!!! fml
Grrr, I should've bought some binoculars for times like this!!! I regret it so much!!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Good Luck!
@GEZI-SISTER Tasty mint candy
@GEZI-SISTER Official spacefood from NASA
@GEZI-SISTER Electromagnetic waves that rain from space
WOOOHOOOO
Tried watching Tenimu to calm down but got horny instead
bleeh, my eyelids are so heavy... is it bc I haven't slept? bc im too turned on? were there too many hot guys that I was panting over? i don't really have anything to do, but i havent slept for almost 3 days now and now im 2 horny 2 sleep...
@FRAUKOUJIRO I've always thought that your energy levels are totally different from the real-life Koujiro-san's...
I can stay awake for another 30 hours. 2ez
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Would you like a glimpse of the reality beyond your senses, senpai? Then you'll know how I feel, duhuhu
I wrapped a dwarf I made on Model 1-kun
*scarf
Why wrap a robot in a scarf? It can't feel cold. Weird
@FRAUKOUJIRO I'm sorry...
@UMISHO It's what you like big brother♪
@FRAUKOUJIRO Nice that you can push yourself while ur young. I can't do it
@FRAUKOUJIRO Is sleep why you are so full of energy online?
@FRAUKOUJIRO You'll get sick if you keep on doing that
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Maybe they are like radiant wings instead of a scarf? The scarf just represents them
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Aki-chan probably thinks that it looks cool
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I hope it doesn't get tangled in its legs and make it fall
Played 10min this morning. 2-0. gtg
I got birthday gifts from my brothers and other students. Made my day!
@UMISHO I know ROBO-ONE. It's the tournament you battle with small robots! Misaki entered it before
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN It's your birthday, Jun?! Why didn't you tell me! Congrats! But I don't have money for a gift... Sorry (Sobs)
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Happy Birthday
Ladies and gentlemen, I have unfortunate news. The ROBO-ONE World Championships that was planned to be held in America was canceled. It looks like it is due to the solar storm. It's not like I should be talking, but it is very unfortunate. Let's pray for the day it will be held!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN HBD~ I will give you some of my thin-books
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Thank you! I know you are in a tight spot Akiho-chan, don't worry about it
@UMISHO Thank you! But uhm, I'm actually nervous for another reason...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Thank you! I'm happy, I didn't expect you to say that, Koujiro-san. But, uh, what are thin-books?
The time has come! Today I'm giving the GO! I was teased for 2 days now, I can't wait!!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Let's take it easy
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Aah, it really is time...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Good luck~
I thought I was gonna die
Seriously reckless...
@UMISHO Sorry for running away...
I was no help at all today. I'm the lowest of the low. They picked me, and I ran away... I'd lost the fight before it even began. I've just been hurting myself by pretending. I kept on ignoring all the frustration and shame in my heart... and I've just kept doing that over and over
Ladies and gentlemen, there are times when it's important to take that one big step, but you can't allow yourself to be satisfied with just a single step. If you think like that, it will end there, with merely that one step. If you're taking the challenge, you must keep on moving forward.
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN No, you were right to not pilot it, really... Hahaha...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Ask yourself why you keep doing it. If you don't figure that out, you'll never change. You've got this!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You haven't been in an extreme situation before, have you Jun-chan?
@UMISHO Yes, thank you for the strict words. I feel better after being scolded
ATTN: Robotics Club members. Today's club activities are off
Today, I bought old BL doujinshi like a madman. Sense of money totally destroyed. Just followed my greed. Felt too good
Hehe.....heheheheh hurry and get here. Damn, I naturally start to grin lolol
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
Played around 2 hours. 26-1
Grrr... Why doesn't Morocco's Kitchen air in Tanegashima! I will not forgive them
Not like it's a problem since I watch it on NicoVid (2ez)
Mufu, but dang olive oil is too dirty lol
@FRAUKOUJIRO Chill out.
My head itches... A lot, but i know the reason tho. it's bc I haven't taken a bath in like 3 days, duhuhu
Since this week is Obon, the dojo is very quiet. It's nice subtimes
*sometimes...
Played while I was waiting. About 30min. 5-0
@FRAUKOUJIRO Why would you post something like this for the whole world to see?
@FRAUKOUJIRO At least take baths. I can't work with you like that
@FRAKOUJIRO You completely tossed out feminity. Figured no one is looking, huh?
@UMISHO Took a bath cuz u made me. A lot of filth came off lol. A clean Frau-tan has been born!1!!1
Tonight's Dinner: BBQ
What is a “cannon”?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Mmmm...
Nothing is coming dowwwwnnn!!!!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Want to come eat?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN But I refuse
@FRAUKOUJIRO I'm sorry...
Played 3 hours. 40-2. Includes fun games with 2 bored people. I crushed them
@GEZI-SISTER Aki-chan said it's a gun you hold in your hand
@GEZI-SISTER Aki-chan said it's a gun that you carry on your shoulder
@GEZI-SISTER Aki-chan said it's a gun that you place on a battleship
Ah, I get hyped from thinking about yesterday! I didn't think it would really fall! It was worth it waiting at the park for 5 days!
Super excited! I just saw something crazy! I wanna say it! But I can't! Anyway, was gonna cry at that moment from being so impressed/touched!
The hyped feeling and sad feelings. They are fighting inside me...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You really can't talk about it?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON What happened?
I want them to stop saying that it's Big Sis's fault. That was an accident, and no one at ExCo was intending to do that. But they still air those words to the public. It's so harsh. Makes them look bad...
NO NO, I'm not gonna think about it! Just change the hype energy to power! One for all! Jakiiin!
I just noticed that i haven't cut my hair in over a year, buuut im just gonna leave it that way. eeyup
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN It's still a secret. Sorry
Played 2 hours at the hangar. 23-0
@UMISHO What is a “Boltvalian”?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON People only look at what's in front of them. Can't be helped. To be fair it is ExCo's bad
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Yeah, even people who don't care about ExCo will feel bad if they get bashed on too much
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you stay on Misa-nee's side, it will be fine
@FRAUKOUJIRO There are salons on the island so maybe get it cut? No wait, you’d be miserable at a place like that, huh
@FRAUKOUJIRO Just cut it yourself. You don't care how it looks, right?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Your hair is like carpet
@GEZI-SISTER A power-type robot in Kill-Ballad
@GEZI-SISTER A robot that is good at aerial combat in Kill-Ballad
@GEZI-SISTER A robot that can shoot in Kill-Ballad
@UMISHO Congrats. I will give you the privilege to cut a woman's hair (I mean mine)
Ladies and gentlemen! At times, you need to fight to pursue your values! It is a beautiful thing to have a passion you are unafraid to fight for!
@UMISHO What is a “pervert”?
Today, I'm going try to stay quiet in the corner...
Played 20min on the bus. 2-1. Had a fight that was 1 frame close, but the bus shaking ruined it. I shouldn't play on the bus
All right, going in-! C.T. Robotics Club! Yoira~iki!
@GEZI-SISTER Someone like Senomiya Akiho
@GEZI-SISTER Someone like Koujiro Frau
@GEZI-SISTER Someone like Nagafukada Mitsuhiko
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You are huffing way too hard... What are you trying to fight?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Counting on your negotiation technique, Aki-chan
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'll be watching from the back
I couldn't keep up with the conversation at all yesterday... Thinking again about why I'm here...
Got so sunburnt from going out for just a bit yesterday lol... Lol...
Kinda stings. Dammit... Imma look like a ganguro gal from 20 years ago!
@FRAUKOUJIRO You want to use my sunblock? Oh, wait, never mind...
I feel motivated! This is the new beginning of the Robotics Club! Let's do thisss! Gonna take on hw one by oneee!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN But I don't refuse
@FRAUKOUJIRO Huh...
@UMISHO Come over for a bit
Frustrated. Played about 3 hours. 33-1
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Aki-chan said we'd build it together, remember? Of course you belong here
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Maybe you should step in a little bit more
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I didn't get it either. Got bored midway
@UMISHO Together, huh. Karate is, besides training, a solo sport in the end, so I kinda like that
@UMISHO Regarding the report, I will help you look for it
@FRAUKOUJIRO Over the phone
Doc got mad at me...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON What...
Played 5min in taxi. 1-0
Arg... Getting roasted by the sun... I don't think I can win, the sun is too strong
Tonight's Dinner: Meat and Potato Stew
So tired... I wanna die...
I'm getting too hopeful. I need to think about Model 1 more
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
A CENTIPEDE!!! I CLOSED THE DOORS HOW JUST DIEEE IM SORRY FORGIVE ME JUST LEAVE!!!!
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH
This island has way too many bugs its not even funny...
@UMISHO What is the inside of the Chikura Cavern like?
Phew...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON @UMISHO @DAITOKU_JUNJUN @Mr_PLEIADES Robotics Club please gather at old airport. I have something I want to show 2ez. Oh, it has nothing to do with bugs lol
@FRAUKOUJIRO Huh? Eh? Wha?
@FRAUKOUJIRO What happened? Bugs?
@FRAUKOUJIRO If you're freaking out over one bug, you're gonna have a hard time living on this island
@FRAUKOUJIRO City people are kinda weak. You'll get use to it
@FRAUKOUJIRO You should ask Madam President for help. She can take out 10-20 bugs at a time with just her bare hands
@GEZI-SISTER It's large enough to sit 1000 people
@GEZI-SISTER It's entirely underwater
@GEZI-SISTER It's like a limestone cavern inside
@UMISHO @AKIPOPOPOPOOON Thank you, thank you!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I don't get it, but go to the hangar too, Jun!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Hooray hooray!
I'm happy that Frau Bow is motivated too. Having allies is great!
Now time to sleep
@FRAUKOUJIRO Good night!
Played 10min during lunch. Hard time matching up. 1-0
16 hours starting now. If you wake me up I will not forgive you
But before that gonna search for some 2D BL media for my pleasure♪
I see that she's facing herself. I will leave her alone. I gotta face down GunBuild-1 too...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Hey...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Uh... not gonna say anything
@FRAUKOUJIRO Just get some rest
@FRAUKOUJIRO Such a pervert
Ooo La La! Found some Kojurou x Masamune loveydovey stuff! Can't sleep!
When I'm by myself I'm able to focus. Maybe I'm not meant to work with other people...
From the very start I always get nervus when people watch. That's why karate tournaments were so bad, and why I loked doing karate in the moning, because no one is there
*nervous *liked *morning That's ir, right?
I am so bad
Uncle Kanade may look intense, but really he's just annoying. But it may be only when he talks to me... Yeah, I get that my requests don't make much money, but he doesn't have to point it out!
Σ(ﾟДﾟ;) Spent 3 whole hours collecting Kojurou x Masamune pics haha.... i have a problem...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Better than getting scolded, right? For me Doc is harder to deal with
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Like it or not, money is everything. Hurry up and get rich Aki-chan
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Did you complain about the inferior goods you were given? You need to speak up for yourself
@FRAUKOUJIRO Go to sleep already
@FRAUKOUJIRO That's a whole another level of stupidity
@FRAUKOUJIRO Must be nice being a shut-in...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN It's okay to take a few days off. No one can stay 100% all the time
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN But I think it's good that you found something only you can do. Now you can use your time wisely
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I think it's amazing that you can still try your best even when no one's watching. You're winning the battle against yourself
@UMISHO Bossy ftw! You can be more bossy duhuhu. Cute senpai with an arrogant attitude will succumb to the sexual schemes of Four Eyes boy AHHH! I'm disappointed but it feels so good
@UMISHO Huh? Kai, where are you? You're not at the hangar
@SISTER_BRAUN Thank you for earlier. Next time, tell me about the bike
Talked a lot with Tennouji-san. Really nice person
These flags are annoying
@Mr_PLEIADES Is the blueprint ready? Is it?
@UMISHO What is “GunBuild-2”?
Played 30min. 4-0
@GEZI-SISTER A small toy
@GEZI-SISTER A hobby robot
@GEZI-SISTER A giant robot
@UMISHO A giant robot! Wow, amazing! I would like to see with my eyes! When it's done please upload it♪
Due to rain, no club activities today!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Osu
Laundry won't dry in this rain...
Played 2 hours. 27-0. Feeling good ♪
Club will be off today too...
I can't eat from the shock of it all
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Keep your head up...
I don't even have words for a friend who's feeling bad. I am so useless...
Ladies and gentlemen, don't be fooled by all the rumors and fake news! Take your time to see the real truth. If you don't, you will regret it hard! In any case, do not panic. If you follow that, you should be fine. A promise from Mr. Pleiades!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Thanks
Done with supervising. Played 3.5 hours. Exactly 40 wins and 1 loss
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I understand your feelings, but don't forget you're the club president
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You've been moving forward the whole time, you should take it slow and get some rest
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON U r treating it like a break up. It's not that special to me
Been a while since I got heated up. Wow, my hands are shaking.
Tonight's Dinner: Teriyaki Spanish Mackerel
Played 4 hours. 42-3
@SISTER_BRAUN I'm heading to TNSC right now, let's get some games in
Shocked about Gunvarrel. 2 days and I'm still not over it. I guess more than shocked, I am disappointed. I get all heated thinking about the last episode. I guess I liked Gunvarrel that much
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't believe everything you see on the internet
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You're always so gullible, Aki-chan
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You are the type to move before you think, so why are you just lounging around?
@UMISHO Are you out Kai?
I did some free practice with Masa-chan, didn't stand a chance. He got strong...
Tonight's Dinner: Hamburg Steak
My head is going crazy, from thinking about it all night
Everyone is looking at the deep parts. I don't get it because I'm not that smart
I don't care about it anymore. I must remember that person's motto: “People can never let go of what they carry until they die.” I like what I like. That should be fine. Done!
I gotta study... Sigh
Kai looked alive...
@UMISHO I wish you tried that hard at the club too. Boo!
What is a “hibiscus”?
Koujiro-san has been quiet these past few days...
@FRAUKOUJIRO How are you?
@GEZI-SISTER A summer flower
@GEZI-SISTER A spring flower
@GEZI-SISTER A fall flower
Got to freshen up. What I need to do is to build GunBuild-2. So, I need that blueprint~
Just waiting is pretty painful...
The last summer of high school is gonna end soon
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Nooo! Don't say thaaattt! I was doing my best to not notice it!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Sorry...
Everyone come out to do club activities~. Even though we are in the waiting phase, we can still do maintenance on GunBuild-1!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Hey, Kai hasn't been himself the past few days. He won't answer me even when I ask. What's up? I get that Subaru has been concentrating on the blueprint, but Frau Bow has been silent too
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Maybe everyone has something they have to deal with? I don't know
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Hey, Aki-chan you wanna do a study group with just the 2 of us. I'm still not done with my hw
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Let's do it! Meet at the club room!
My counselor said attending college would be hard for me... I did terrible on that last tast before summer...
*test
Lots of students at the dojo. Thinking about my brothers' schooling. Maybe I should get a job instead of going to college...
I can't stay like this. Can't be playing all the time. There is only half a year left till graduation...
I am saddened about the riots still going on in America. I pray that it will end soon and that the ROBO-ONE World Championships will be held. I won't say robots can save the world, but we can pray to stop the fighting over robots. That is something I and everyone can do!
ATTN: Robotics Club members! Meet at the Space Center tomorrow! I will show you something amazing! Hehehe!
I know he told me not to use his name since he'd be exposed, so imma call him No. 1 Sasssy Younger Male Robotics Club Member S-kun on Twipo from now on!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN There are colleges that you don't need to take a test to get in, why not go to one of those?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Didn't know you were the same as me and Aki-chan. We're all pretty dumb
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You shoulda seen this coming if you joined the Robotics Club to dodge studying lol
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Nowadays, it's pretty hard to find a job. Not too many places hire high school graduates
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If you go out to Fukuoka, I think you can get by as a part-timer. But if you want to send money it'll be a little rough
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I need to think about after graduation too. I haven't decided on anything. Not good
Played 5min first thing this morning. 1-0. All right, let's get going...
@UMISHO Aren't those places usually private schools? Tuition will cost a lot and I need to think if I want to go that badly...
@UMISHO Yeah, you're right. I'm just running away from it...
@UMISHO It is too hard to find one on the island...
@UMISHO It is too hard to find one on the island...
I know it's Sunday and everyone wants to sleep in, but don't be late to the meet up!
Blood Tune, RaiNet Kakeru, Z Gunbam. Have you seen any of these anime?
If I am going to decide, the timing is now... Before I cause more trouble to everyone...
Hehe, I can picture everyones surprised faces~
@GEZI-SISTER Z Gunbam!
Played 5min in JAXA micro-bus. 1-0
@GEZI-SISTER Blood Tune
@GEZI-SISTER RaiNet Kakeru
@GEZI-SISTER Z Gunbam
I'm glad that Doc is okay. Geez, that surprised me
Let's go visit him!
Hey everyone. Today is Respect for the Elderly Day. I respect those who respect their elders! Grandpas and grandmas will be very happy just seeing your faces! The perfect gift would be to offer them a massage! Now, let's put it into action! A promise from Mr. Pleiades!
Robots are friends, huh...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOOON They are♪ That's why I and Akiho are friends too♪
@GEZI-SISTER Airi doesn't feel like a robot at all. Hehehe
Played 10min before heading to the hangar. 2-0
Hey everyone. Work on a robot's cosmetics after you've proved the performance and capability backed by technology. If you're building a robot on looks that can't fight, you should be building a figure. What's demanded of a robot is performance. Looks come after. Remember that!
Played 20min. 3-0. Off to Robot Clinic
@UMISHO What's hidden in the secret base?
@GEZI-SISTER A book of prophecies
@GEZI-SISTER Eroge
@GEZI-SISTER A giant robot
Feels kinda fresh. Once in a while, old designs can actually feel new!
Tin-plated robot toys didn't even exist when we were kids. I don't feel nostalgic but it feels nice.
But nonetheless, I like robots that are like Bang! Jakiiin! Horns coming out of their head or shoulders. An animal face on the chest, and it combines together!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON There are a lot of robots with an animal face on their chests. Even I've noticed that. I wonder why?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you say things like that, S-kun's gonna tell you to quit talking nonsense
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Jakiiin and Bang really show the prowess of your vocab
@UMISHO It's because it's cool! You don't understand, Kai. You really don't
@UMISHO S-kun? Oh Subaru is S-kun!
Woke up, played 1 hour. 10-0
I'm still not doing good enough...
I will fix it. I am actually better at repairing. Got lots of time since all I do is maintenance. Even if I get in trouble it'll be worth it!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You have to come! If you don't, I'm going to pick you up!
Robots are friends, huh...
I want to be friends with them, but I can't see them...
Kai rarely helps out. Usually he won't help cuz he says he's lazy
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN U don't need to go if u can't. Aki-chan is a bit pushy
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Live without regrets
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If you stay sad like that nothing will change
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Don't push Jun-chan too much. I will help instead
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you are by yourself, you might get caught trespassing. I'm just guarding you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I have my own reasons. It's a secret
Robot Doctor killing robots. Doctors should be fixing them. This is just too sad...
@UMISHO What is your favorite robot?
@GEZI-SISTER Gunbam
@GEZI-SISTER Gunvarrel
@GEZI-SISTER I have multiple
Don't disgrace Gunvarrel!!1
Played 30min. 7-0
Recently, I've been itching for those blueprints and, surprisingly, I'm getting motivated to fix it up
The same thing happened with GunBuild-1. Throwing robots away is not acceptable. You are the one who told me that, Doc
@FRAUKOUJIRO You good? What happened?
What am I doing here...?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You're here at Robo Clinic, which means you care
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You are worried about Doc. That should be enough. Don't overthink it
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If you are here, it's because you were told to be. I don't think you need to come down
This robot's build is simple. I think even I can do it
It being simple is very nice. Maintenance is so much easier♪
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON You actually can do maintenance. Respect
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Then you should've made Model-1 simple too
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It still goes way over my head
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN How was yesterday?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Are you coming to school today? Can I come visit you at class?
Played 15 min. 2-1. Dammit!
Going to Robo Clinic solo today. I thought Kai was getting motivated, but that was only in the beginning...
Repairing was fun, seeing it fixed was fun, but right now, I'm just sad
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Aki-chan, just keep being yourself. Staying positive for no good reason is your best quality
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Why so down from just a club quiting notice? Robotics Club had just 2 members. Nothing to panic about
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If it's hard, you can quit. This has nothing to do with your dream
@UMISHO Thanks, Kai. I am going to do what I can. I believe we can be friends with robots
@UMISHO Thanks, Kai. I am going to do what I can. I believe we can be friends with robots
@UMISHO Thanks, Kai! I am going to leave that to you!
@UMISHO What kind of world do you wish for, Big Brother?
Played 3min. 1-0. Guess I'll go...
@GEZI-SISTER A controlled, peaceful society
@GEZI-SISTER A chaotic, cruel society
@GEZI-SISTER A moe-ruled society
@UMISHO Kai! How'd the mission go?! Let me know when you're done!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Phew, I was nervous. I was more nervous than at ROBO-ONE
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I led the Daitoku boys by the nose
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Jun-chan's food was good
All right, I'm ready! GO/NO-GO's decision will be a GO!
Played 30min. 7-0. Ready to go
What I can do. What I want to do. I don't know clearly but...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Heading over now!
Everyone in Robotics Club, tank you...
*thank you Aaah!
Ah ha, I think I have talent as an event producer. Like a wedding planner! Well, I don't plan on being one though! Cuz my dream~ is to build a robot! Hehe~!
Speaking of! It's already October! Gotta start building GunBuild-2!
@UMISHO From Sister Centipede to Yashio-san, I would like to introduce someone perfect for your hobby. He is an old online friend and his name is Lightning-Fast Neidhardt. I think you will get along
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN It's the results of your hard work. You should be proud of yourself
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If you feel like you now like robots even a little bit can you undo your club quitting notification
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN All I did was get treated by your cooking and picked up Doc at the hospital
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Back to being yourself again...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It was your achievement. That's why you are club president!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I think the whole island shook from your talent. Probably
It's been a while since I've had a dream. Usually I sleep so deep I don't remember my dreams
Surprise plan, GO/NO-GO's decision will be a GO!
Aki-chan came to pick me up. Played 20min. 3-1. Ugh...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Been a while since you posted. How are you?
@FRAUKOUJIRO I thought you died since you haven't been around
@FRAUKOUJIRO Maybe the thing that you think is a dream is actually reality? Jk
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what is most important when it comes to operating a hobby robot? Yes, the control system. If that is made firmly it can easily cover any hardware handicap. However, if the control system is bad, you'll only make a bad robot no matter how much you spend!
I think this is the first time in 2 1/2 years that I felt this fulfilled since I joined Robotics Club. Oh, it's so fun! I wish this started 2 years ago! Moewaki-senpai, are you watching?! Robotics Club is finally moving forwaaarrrddd!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I think it's fun too. I would've never felt like this in karate. The working together as part of a team thing is wonderful
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN RIGHT?! I am beyond thrilled that you understand the fun of being in the Robotics Club
Doc turned into a mad scientist!
What is a “mad scientist”?
@GEZI-SISTER Someone that makes dangerous inventions?
@GEZI-SISTER Someone once said that it's the kinda person who gets mad if you call em chuunibyou.
@GEZI-SISTER Aki-chan said it's a crazy person who makes some sort of research center and builds giant robots by himself or whatever blahblahblah
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Glad you are having fun. You look better when you're care free about making robots than when you're hesitant. In a good way!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you stay full of yourself someone'll knock you off your feet with a sweeping fierce kick
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Who was Moewaki-senpai again? Was that his name?
@UMISHO What?! He was the club president until last year! Moewaki-senpai! How can you forget a weird person like him?! Can't believe ittt!
The runway is getting cold...
@UMISHO Say hi to Frau Bow for me!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If we are just motion capturing, we don't need to be on the runway
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I think there was a oil stove nestled in the back of the hangar. You can use it if you bring your own oil
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN The wind is really strong. Be careful if you are wearing a skirt. It might flip if you aren't careful
I didn't even think that I'd be going to Robotics Club with S-kun 6 months ago...
Played a quick 30min. 7-1. I guess it's time to send them off?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's a good thing that you get along now lol. Winning both S-kun and Doc to your side means you're amazing, Aki-chan
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I dunno about you, but I think S-kun got a lot more mellow
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I dunno about you, but I think Doc got a lot more mellow
Recently, my sheet metaling skills have gone up a lot. If I keep it going can I become the Second Robot Doctor?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Full of yourself again, huh. So obvious about it
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Nice. Now you have a job. You don't have to worry about after graduating
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Doc is gonna be furious if you keep talking like that
Surfing...
That old man is really bad for your heart!
I thought my chest was going to explode...
@UMISHO Do you like women's breasts, Big Brother? How about ones that are underdeveloped? Are they acceptable even if they have no hope of growth?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Sorry that grandpa is causing trouble
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN No, no it's not like I'm mad! Sorry for making you feel bad. Glad Doc is ok
Ppl in Tokyo, are you ok?!
I wonder what's going to happen to Tokyo...
Lag is getting worse for KB. I hope it's temporary
@GEZI-SISTER Most guys tend to like 'em bigger
@GEZI-SISTER Flat is justice. As it is written in the sacred texts
@GEZI SISTER WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON This was expected to happen... Should've taken it seriously
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Might be as bad as the Crash of '15 or even worse
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON At least Tanegashima is safe
Tokyo looks like it's in big trouble...
@UMISHO What do you think about being called “Big Brother” by me? Shall I change it to something like “Big Bro” or “Broski” or “Bro-Bro?” Or rather, I can copy myself 12 times and each one could call you something different. Standing by.
So, you know how robots in Tokyo are going nuts and attacking people? That was me.
I hacked into RI's RIICH Series OS. That part was easy. After that, I made all the RI robots go haywire.
I think it's time for robots to be freed from human control.
Oh yeah, and wanna know who leaked the last episode of Gunvarrel? Also me!
Btw, the server for RI is wide open. Anyone can waltz right on in.
You wanna boot me out and get the robots back? Just get past the security I set up.
@FRAUKOUJIRO What?
@FRAUKOUJIRO What's going on?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Stop joking
@GEZI-SISTER Big Brother's fine
@GEZI-SISTER Please don't call me any of those. It's embarrassing...
@GEZI-SISTER What the hell are you talking about...?
@UMISHO But I refuse
@UMISHO If Big Brother was able to choose my outfit, what would you like it to be? No matter what you answer, there will be no DLC added. Even if someone were to offer to pay for it, there still would be no additions. Especially if they're sexual in nature.
Quick update: Kona-chan is ok. And didn't do anything bad
@UMISHO Nice job, Kai!
@UMISHO Thank god~
@GEZI-SISTER The usual is fine...
@GEZI-SISTER A swimsuit
@GEZI-SISTER How about a catgirl maid? Give it a chance
I won't be misled. I already learned that from the final episode. I will believe and wait
@UMISHO If you could use me for anything, what would you do? Would you use me for pleasure?
@GEZI-SISTER I would make you my girlfriend
@GEZI-SISTER I would make you my navigator
@GEZI-SISTER I would delete you
The TV isn't working. Is this from the solar storm? Can't watch the news like this. Didn't think this island would be affected too
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN My PokeCom isn't working well. Apps keep crashing. But, I guess it's better than others. There might be people that had their PokeCom break in Tokyo
This is the first time I've ever felt like I don't wanna play KB
@UMISHO From Sister Centipede to Yashio-san, I've found someone I want to introduce who seems perfect for your hobby. The person's name is DaSH. He gets mad if you call him Super Hacka, so please be careful
White bread. Grab the white bread! Put it in your mouth and wait at a intersection by the school gate. If you do that a flag will go up and Frau-tan will win lolol hehe lolol duhuhu lololol
@UMISHO I'll pick you up at your house. Been a while since we went to school. Let's go together!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I still feel sick
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I wanted to stay away until graduation
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Of course. I mean, I am your guardian
Wooow, this years Winter ComiMa has a lot more ppl from the Gunvarrel fandom than i expected... i thought it would be a lot less but now im actually thinking about going... it wasnt a dead series after all...
FRAUKOUJIRO_FACTORY will not have a new issue. I mean that happened, and I wasn't planning to participate
TBH keeping ComiMa running despite Tokyo being in total chaos is crazy, in a good way lol. Still selling analog thin-books
Finished testinggg. Last test of my hs life, I think? I bet the results are going to bad...
@FRAUKOUJIRO I've only seen ComiMa on the news
@FRAUKOUJIRO ComiMa is an event that people in the countryside watch while weeping from FOMO
@FRAUKOUJIRO Have you gone before? I heard that it's a no-newcomers-allowed sort of event. Is that true?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Since it's our last test, I wish we'd done better
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN No need to get depressed. I mean, it's the last one anyway...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Ending with a bang because it's the last, I think, is an aesthetic
Subaru is still kinda stuck up...
Played 1 hour. 10-2. Break
I wonder if the others on the island will help in the first place... They don't treat us positively
Is money really everything...
Todays Dinner: Making a Pot of Meatballs
@UMISHO Exactly. That is right
 Released. No character adjustments. Mainly updated security for online matches
Also considering going open source very soon. I mean my bad for that thing that happened. Looking for volunteers to manage servers. Ded serious
Hanju, ChuChu-shi, and Kisspop-dono are probably gonna be mad
IN THE SKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
@GEZI-SISTER What... The...?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON That's just an excuse. You have to do something about it. That's it
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Might be karma from your everyday deeds. I mean you're a troublemaker that fights back against VP
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Prostrate yourself, offer up your panties, or force it by invoking Doc's authority. Pick whichever one you like
@GEZI-SISTER Are you broken?
@GEZI-SISTER Are you ok?
@GEZI-SISTER That's the scream of your soul
I want to play KB...
Sand
Ladies and gentlemen! A lot has happened this year. The end of year ROBO-ONE will be held as scheduled, but it won't be a tournament. There will be demonstrations for the main program. I won't be participating since I have retired, but people who will, please give it your all for me!
It may be time for me to close this account. I am considering returning to life as a regular man. Can't be Pleiades forever. I will be stopping before the year ends. There isn't much time left, but everyone keep it up!
Is ‘IRUO.’ really going in maintenance? There's nothing more annoying than doing maintenance on Christmas Eve. YAS, do it more lololol
@GEZI-SISTER Hm? What happened?
@GEZI-SISTER Playing in the sand?
@GEZI-SISTER Sounds like you are malfunctioning
I want to eat ham
@UMISHO I've gone to ComiMa a few times, but unless you possess brute strength, going through general admissions is impossible. You'll see hell if you are trying to go as a guest. I wouldn't be surprised if someone died. But sometimes, you want to go to that hell. Such a mystery
@UMISHO Its not a playground, its a battlefield. way 2 many ppl. in summer u have to w8 in line for hrs under the blazing sun. ive w8d for 4 straight hrs b4. one time even tho a guy in front of me was basically shitting himself, i had to deal w/ the smell just to stay in line
Today, Okinawan donuts arrived in the mail. It's for Christmas♪
LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON LOLICON
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Is that something like a donut hole?
@GEZI-SISTER No more
@FRAUKOUJIRO It's food
@FRAUKOUJIRO I respect the passion, but I don't want to grow up like that
@FRAUKOUJIRO Huh. So people just power through it and no one complains?
@FRAUKOUJIRO Adding body heat on top of that must be way worse than heat on the island
@GEZI-SISTER Having a Gestaltzerfall?
@GEZI-SISTER Stop. Respect your master
@GEZI-SISTER Sorry, that made me laugh
Day 2 building at TNSC. Making progress ♪
Doc came to help. He's eating lunch... A cute handmade benttto!!!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I made that...
Kashikashi
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Make one for Aki-chan too. She doesn't eat right on her days off or when she's at the hangar
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Then it must taste good. Lucky
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN That old man has calmed down
@GEZI-SISTER Khakis?
@GEZI-SISTER Cashews?
@GEZI-SISTER Kamikaze?
@UMISHO Oh, I forgot to tell you yesterday, but you should blow dry your hair. You'll catch a cold... Oh, who cares! Uhm, sorry!
Today will be a mid-summer day. Air temperature: high of 4 degrees Celsius
@UMISHO Current attendance on Day 1 of ComiMa is about 300k. 3 years ago, the holy lands where its held were expanded and it turned to chaos after that. About 30% travel from overseas. btw the people from the countryside have rly intense eyes
Played 30min. 5-1. Heading out
@FRAUKOUJIRO I got the chills just imagining it. In a bad way
@FRAUKOUJIRO How did you live through such a battlefield...
@FRAUKOUJIRO Easily 10x the population of Tanegashima...
I don't get why we go to school on the 24th and 25th. I could focus on production if we had those days off
@UMISHO I was on the winner's side because I had a group ticket from helping Mama's group. Mama's group was by the wall once. I was the sales girl. All I did was help prepare then lined up in the major companies with Mama. duhuhu
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON 24th and 25th should disappear in a vortex
Winter break is crunch time! If we don't work hard now, we won't make it to the expo. Can't be all jolly just cuz it's Christmas! Everyone please!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Uhm, calm down...
Ah, but, I would like to do a small Christmas party with the members of the Robotics Club. I don't know how many times all 5 of us will be gathered together. Let's have cake as a pre-party for GunBuild-2 completion
At my house we have a custom that every Christmas we celebrate with cream covered Okinawan donuts. It's probably from the Okinawan blood in us ♪
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON @DAITOKU_JUNJUN You trader! How could you betray me!
@FRAUKOUJIRO Wha? What?!
Christmas Eve...
If this is the case, imma make UMISHO-senpai put on Four Eyes and wear a santa outfit, but when he takes it off he is naked with a ribbon wrapped around his neck. Then he'll say “I am, we are, the Christmas present” I want to have a delusion of that so bad I need him to be there
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Sounds like a lot of calories...
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN First I've ever heard of that custom. Does it even exist in Okinawa?
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Sounds good. Next time treat just me
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Good idea. Breaks are needed
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Last Christmas of the hs life... So fast
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Could you not...
@GEZI-SISTER It'd be nice if it lasted until tomorrow
@GEZI-SISTER Enjoy the Eve Eve rather than the actual Eve
@GEZI-SISTER I'm glad you're excited...
Entangleeee
Tbh, shouldn't it be fried chicken for Christmas? SMH. But there aren't any stores on the island. Oh well, Christmas is canceled!
@FRAUKOUJIRO To tell the truth, twice a month, they traveled from Kagoshima to sell it here. But due to the solar storm in August they have been holding it off
@GEZI-SISTER May this feeling never disappear!
Normies should all go die
Taking a walk is fun♪ I hope I can get home♪
I'm sure your long sleep will be lonely, but worry not. I'll show you a dream.
I'll make it so that you can walk around freely within ‘IRUO.’, as though it were your garden.
A weather control device, eh? That might be bit beyond me.
Good night, sleeping beauty.
You'll escape the hardships, but you'll also leave behind all that joy.
You're still young.
GunBuild-2, pre-prep is finished. Going all-in!! Jakiiin!
@UMISHO Still not home? The lights were off in your room
@UMISHO If u r interested in thin-books, I have a friend in Tokyo who can get them for you. A regular attendee at ComiMa each year. I only know them online, but I heard they r friends with DaSH. Username: KuriGohan and Kamehameha
Wooo! The time has come! It's winter break! Get HYPED!
Played 1 hour. 10-0. A crazy hyped club Prez came to pick me up
Less than a month till the Expooo!
Everyone has to be there today! That's an order! Frau Bow too!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON But I refuse
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Yeah, yeah
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm looking forward to it!
Dad lately has been doing a lot of overtime, but it was because of the rocket. So lively, that he is like a different person. Must be fun
But! I am way more! Lively! Won't lose to him!
Model 2-chan is amazing. The movement is way different from Model 1-kun. To think Robotics Club made it. It's awe-inspiring
I can kinda go outside because the sunlight is weaker in the winter. I would die in the summer lol... Not really...
Operating. Feeling nervous, worried I might make a mistake. A small person like me making such a giant thing. My own hands making it move. I still can't believe it
All it takes is one tiny mistake for a total disaster. Gotta stay focused!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Ur old man is still lively. I'm jealous he can keep up that level of passion at his age
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I've been thinking about it. The technicians at JAXA act like kids whenever they start talking about rockets
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON He's basically been house-sitting the whole time. It must be exciting to finally have a project to work on
@DAITOKU@JUNJUN You are already a full-fledged operator. Makes me happy
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Doesn't sound like you need me anymore. Good job
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN As your senpai, I say you need to prove yourself with your actions, not your words
In the video of GunBuild-2 that we filmed for the Expo it'd be better if, aside from our meet and greet part, GunBuild-2 looked cooler! I want to add awesome BGM and SFXs but S-kun won't let me... I wonder if that'll be fine...
I think it might be the first time riding in the back of the truck
Leaving TNSC!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's not like it's an anime...
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Why use BGM or SFXs in the first place?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON oh yeah, that kinda stuff would def. help it
There isn't anything more sad than Gunvarrel drifting away from the hearts of children...
I will never hate it! I promise!
Thinking about it, Takaki-kun from our dojo doesn't talk about Gunvarrel anymore
Arrived at hangar!
Assembly is finished! Liftoff is a GO!
Liftoff success! SO HYPED!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON It's cuz that incident was so public. Nothing you can do about that
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I didn't think it was a good series in the first place
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Isn't what really matters is if you like it or not?
Test operation again today. Huh? Where did Kai go? He was just here
Heyyyyyyy I just found an illustration of Tanegashima and Yakushima personified and what is this?! Popular Yakushima has World Heritage branded on its bottom and jealous Tanegashima goes on the attack. They really get me YAHOOOOOO!
But Yakushima is tsundere right. I get it. They're gonna cuddle with Tanegashima. Y: “Guess you need me” Tanegashima gets all flustered waaah I wanna read a thin-book about ittttttttttt
@FRAUKOUJIRO I don't know what's going on, but come to the hangar. Testing's about to beginnn
Hrng, I was just getting heated up but club activities got in my way. wallpunch
It's almost graduation. I didn't think I'd be operating a robot around this time... But this feels right
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Can't run away from reality forever lol
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Getting over it is important. Maybe you are becoming one of us
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I still haven't decided what I'm going to do...
Kai, ditching at a time like this! I'll make Jun the official operator if this continues!
Getting used to operating. At least I'm no longer nervous. And Model-2-chan might be kind of cute. Am I the only one who thinks this?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I have no issue with that
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Rather than being mad at me ditching, you should compliment Jun-chan's progress
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON At the end, we'll decide who is better in a direct challenge
@UMISHO TOO BAD!
@UMISHO I compliment Jun a lot. You'd know if you were here!
@UMISHO How rude...
The wind is strong todaaayyy
S-kun, Jun, and Frau Bow changed. Everyone showed up for testing. We are united! Kai, you are the only who hasn't changed
It's cold... I wanna go home. I'm gonna cough out blood from all the excitement about Tanegashima x Yakushima
With the release of Kimijima Report No. 7, all the Kimijima Reports will be copied limitlessly and will spread out to the world. However, the  connected to the reports will not be shared due to debug. Will monitor and report the situation as it continues to spread

Regarding the rental car they said there was a memo left behind stating “GS Fr.” True story. Someone figure out what it means plz
Made it! The land of the final battle! Tokyo, I have come backkk!
Tokyo is a lot calmer than I thought. It's only been a few months since the solar storm. A lot more cheerful
The Expo arena looked really big, but it might be a little crowded thinking about multiple robots that are +10m lined up. I wanted to do it outdoors if possible. Can't though since it's a long event
Checked the venue. Heading to hotel!
Reporting an update for the spread of the Kimijima Reports. As of February 18, 2020 68% have spread worldwide. Total completion: 12%. England: Passed 80%. Egypt: Passed 50%. Kazakhstan: Confirmed start of spread
I'm up! Been a while since I got this much sleep. Maybe because it was a nice hotel? Hotel power is amazing! Though I was a bit nervous in the beginning hehe
WOOO! Bringing my game face! Gotta force myself to feel more motivated! But first, shower time!
@EXOSKELETON_SENOMIYA Hey, you home? Can I come over?! I'm gonna come!
Is she there? Will we be able to see her? I miss her...
Starting assembly today!
A little worried all by myself. Makes me think they might not come back...
Let's do this!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I'm already in Odaiba. Don't worry
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Already missing the island? Homesick, huh
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON If you have time to think, then work, k?

Just saw something disturbing. I will accept the criticism, but I still want to fight with Gunvarrel. Because it's my favorite mecha anime. Because it's the robot big sister chose
Reporting an update for the spread of the Kimijima Reports. As of February 22, 2020 71% has spread worldwide. Total completion: 13%. Singapore: Passed 90% . Russia: Passed 10%. India: Increase by 420% in the past 24 hours confirmed
Pulled an all-nighter marathoning Gunvarrel! A little sleepy but I got this!
I wonder if big sister is watching...
Finally, today is the opening day for Tokyo Expo. Tanegashima Robotics Club, exhibiting at booth R2-9! Please stop by!
Reporting an update for the spread of the Kimijima Reports. As of February 26, 2020 79% has spread worldwide. Total completion: 16%. Spain: Passed 80%. Finland: Passed 70%. Japan: Completion Passed 30%
ATTN: Currently performing at booth R2-9 via Tokyo Expo, Odaiba Arena! Please stop by!
Going on TV after this!
Wow, what is this? Odaiba breaking down... aren't senpais in trouble?
TAIYO Development looks totally back. Are they at full power?
At times like this the street view mode on ‘IRUO.’ is handy...
I mean, who uped the picture of Odaiba anyway? If the buildings were destroyed that badly, people at the venue might be dead. Plus there's a solar storm, but somehow the whole thing was uploaded normally?
Hoshita Sakae? Who was that again? I think I heard of him
Mama isn't a murderer. That's all I can say
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON @UMISHO Heard the story. I'll be waiting at the hangar!
@Mr_PLEIADES If you post on that account, people are going to figure out who you are
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON @UMISHO Now is not the time for that! Don't worry about nonsense!
Eh... I got scolded...
I'll persevere! Hidaka-kun forgave me! I'll be Hidaka-kun's legs! I have confidence in my stamina!
Looks like we're arriving at the old airport!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON @UMISHO I will have balefires up on the runway to guide you. It's raining, but they should last for a bit
No problem, I believe in Mr. Shigemi!
@Mr_PLEIADES Landing soon!
@Mr_PLEIADES Did you get your account hacked?
@Mr_PLEIADES Looks like you grew up a bit, S-kun
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Let's see the real you
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN I'm glad you are feeling better
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN You quit being a wimp. Atta girl
Things we can do. Things that only we can do. That's what we're doing
Not yet! This won't end yet!
There are so many people helping the Robotics Club. Nothing can get better than this!
@EXOSKELETON_SENOMIYA Why?
Nocchiyo, Airi
I thought I hated cheats, but now I am the cheater. This time though, I'm gonna take that handicap
I didn't think there would be a time that I would be teaching assembly to everyone, but I noticed I can teach. Looks like I grew up a bit too
wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch wallpunch
@UMISHO You scared me. I really thought my heart was going to stop! Don't make me worry!
Just saw Real Airi-tan and healed up. Functioning as Intended! Sleepiness has blown away! Want to pull some dirty pranks but kept it to myself duhuhu
@UMISHO You need to just rest, Kai! Your time will come later. Stay in the best condition you can, don't let everybody's hard work go to waste. Counting on you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Right, I know
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON Yeah, yeah I'll leave it you
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON That robot better be perfect, Aki-chan
If we had another half day it could've been better
People on the island, thank you so much. We made it thanks to your hard work. We were able to keep going because you were there
Despite its bad shape and poor functionality, Super GunBuild-1 is looking cool
Super Model-1-kun is such a cool looking guy♪
You mean cute rather than cool, SMH. The model it was based off was good because Kogoori Minami poured her soul into it
We will win this fight! Storm and surge! Blast of Spirit, Gunvarrel!
 The Exoskeleton Company is currently running a campaign to celebrate three million HUG Series units sold. During the campaign period, everyone who buys the HUG-06 KARUMA, introduced today, will get 10,000 yen cash back. Please contact official dealers for further details
Time goes peacefully by here at the Tanegashima Space Center. To prepare for summer's open-house, young employees are working hard making plastic bottle rockets for the facility.
 Releasing new patch. We just released ver 3.22 a month ago, but after looking at user comments I have some parts I want to work on. Details to come soon
@UMISHO It's fine to be into your club activities, but if you're going to be late it'd be nice to let me know. Dinner will get cold
The sky is nice. I fly the same route at the same time, but it feels really good. Flying over the shining sea, cutting through the wind, it lets you forget about all the bad things
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Of course, I don't have anything I don't like in the family. I love you and our son
 The best types of relationships in our societies to have are those where you can have “IOUs”
Collarbones are kinda hot
 Today at 3:00pm I will be appearing on the FujisunTV's show “Three O'clock Madam.” Thank you very much
Earlier I found a picture of the H-ⅡA Rocket Model 17 launch while sorting the documents in the manager's office. So nostalgic. Maybe I'll put it up in the lobby of the museum
Laundry isn't drying in this rain.
Copped a rare thin-book from 12 years ago~ My heart is getting heated up. It costed about 80,000 yen. Paid in cash, no problem
 The atmosphere in the teacher's lounge is tense. Staying quiet in the corner is the way to go. Seriously
Phew, I thought I was going to get killed by that glare. I won't stop the students taking risks, but please don't let the fire come this way
Man, I can't get anything done after importing Genki-kun bot and Rosetta-tan bot into the PokeCom lol These guys are annoying lolol I'm the one who programmed them lolol Weee lolol
 The Exoskeleton Company is currently running a campaign to celebrate three million HUG Series units sold. During the campaign period, everyone who buys the HUG-06 KARUMA, introduced today, will get 10,000 yen cash back. Please contact official dealers for further details
TanegashiMachine 3, huh. So nostalgic. Wonder how long ago that was
On the streets of Ikebukuro, I saw a girl crossplayer dressed up as a butler with thick soled shoes fall over. Then a kid with long black hair ran to the cosplayer and said “Hurry and get up.” They replied: “Yes, Master” and stood up. Couldn't help but scream “GJ!”
I thought it was a filming of a TV show lololol
Received tea from my sister-in-law in Shizuoka. There's a lot, so I'm going to share with my neighbors♪
It's ok to do club activities on the weekend, but the supervisor doesn't need to be there. What do they think of workers working under low income
 To do hard work, moderate breaks are needed
I will be heading home as a passenger since the hangar for my plane is only at the Kagoshima Airport. I sit as a passenger of a plane as my comrade pilots me to the island where I live. After that, I will no longer have any wings
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Can you grab some nappa lettuce on the way home? After you land, obviously
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Of course, my lovely wife. Leave it to me. I will cast my wings aside and fetch some nappa lettuce
Kids these days think that they can get professional help and knowledge without paying any money. In my time you would become an apprentice to your teacher and steal their skills by learning
From Robot Doctor. New parts are in. Batteries and chargers from Ogawada. Got a good amount of them. Also, got a rare 09' 3 core speed censor moduler. A very rare product made by KaiserTech. First come, first served
Seriously, there's too many cheaters. This is never ending
Is this really going to make it in time... You can't count on those two from the Robotics Club. If I, the supervisor, didn't lead them they'd miss the due date. We'd be working on it forever
 When you can't do a task, saying that you can't and giving up is sometimes the right way to go as an adult. Hope you're listening, students!
Last night, my younger daughter was in the living room striking a weird pose with one of her legs up. What should I do? A little worried about her future
@TNSC_SENOMIYA Oh my! Sound like she is doing well. All that our son does is play games!
Are they still working on it? It's time for kids to go home and sleeeeeep
Good morning guys lolol it's already night though lolol
@UMISHO Recently, you been really late. I already made dinner. Club activities are fine, but didn't I say to contact me when you're going to be late?
Robotics Club making hobby robots. Reminds me of about 9 years ago. Wait, or was it 8 years ago?
Free-range chickens are so good! Drinking sweet potato shochu with free-range chicken for lunch is amazing! Still, I can't eat free-range chicken all the time since it's expensive
Life's easy for a PE teacher during exams!
I don't think my son ever studies. Every time I scold him he says it's fine. Well, it's on him to go to college or get a job. Wasn't planning on helping him anyway
The young man living next door is such a gentleman. He helps my daughter without saying anything. It's really kind. I feel safe leaving my daughter with him
@TNSC_SENOMIYA Boys grow up by protecting those they cherish
@TIDELINE-EIGHT You wrote “Boys” but you mean “Men.”
Looking at thin-books after work is phenomenal lolol duhuhu lolol
Sorry, ya'll better log off! Gays only!
Oh dang! I haven't done any prep for the Tokyo trip! What am I supposed to bring? PJs, tooth brush, razor, wallet... What am I supposed to wear? Formal? Is a regular suit ok?
Got to get the plane ticket before that. Can I write it off for expenses? Wait, is going by sea cheaper? Which should I choose
All things considered, ROBO-ONE huh...
What else do I need to do? Book a hotel? Going away is such a hassle. The sports club teachers do this all the time. Can't believe it
Two days from now, the 41st ROBO-ONE will be held at the Odaiba Expo Arena in Tokyo. Our company will be cosponsoring the event and there will be a demonstration of the HUG at the venue. Please spread the word and come by
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Will they be okay to enter a tournament in Tokyo? I am worried for Akiho-chan. I don't think she can rely on Kaito for that
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA To go farther, people crouch down when they prepare to jump. Kids have more flexible feet and waist so preparing for it pays off better
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
Well, I don't think the idea is bad. I don't know if they will win or not. At least the parts are perfect. Program setting is the last thing
Will there be live report on TV today? Is it going to be aired on the island at all? I think they did during last New Year's Eve
Geez, complaining about where we're staying when you're a student
 Endure the hardships you can while you're young. Gain the courage it takes to sleep on the floor of a small, dirty room
Wow! My daughter is in the ROBO-ONE Grandfinals happening in Tokyo! Currently, watching with the members of TNSC. Good Luck!
Are you able to watch the match online? I really don't understand what I need to do to watch. I wish we could just tune in to a TV channel
Got invited by Senomiya-san, so watching with her♪
Yesterday, Chuo Tanegashima High Robotics Club got 2nd place after a close game at ROBO-ONE. They did well! On behalf of my daughter, I would like to thank everyone who cheered them on
Still not enough training
People grow stronger by enduring losses. Son, do not forget the taste of those tears. One day their bitterness will be rewarded. Still, I am proud of you

Oof, didn't think they'd find me. Who leaked it to the media. I was living as a neutral otaku, but now they know Imma high school otaku girl (plus a shut-in) dammit
So from now on, I'll be showing the real Koujiro Frau. You're probably like, “The real Koujiro Frau?” To summarize myself, let's just say I'm rotten to the core. Too fast duhuhu. 2ez. That's who I am
I received a hard request from my daughter. Troubled. I want to help her, but...
It's super inconvenient! This hotel (more like an inn lol) doesn't have LAN for PCs. Use my PokeCom? I like desktops more than PokeComs! Yeah, desktops are wacky, but it sucks to be a girl so lost in time dammit
Scumbag little brat hasn't come back to pay their debt. Kids these days...
What is this, why do I have to help move? Is this part of my job? No, it's not! This is bullying, harassment! This is scary. Tbh, I'm getting worried about my teaching career
 Today at 22:00, I will be appearing on BSWestTV “Modern Looks!” Please support me!
@UMISHO You are late. Are you having dinner with us?
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON The way they did it was dirty. But, that's the way the world goes. Don't feel down, Little Senomiya~!
What was the issue of the 46 second freeze yesterday? I was watchin Teninu you know! I will never forgive them, never! It pissed me off, so gonna stop going to school. It's my first day but not going anymore
Boys are required to keep calm in any situation. Doesn't matter if it's a major disaster or a big ol' bug crawling around the house. That's what makes you the protector of the family
Please read “Boys” as “Men”
@UMISHO Thanks for helping out with moving. As thanks, I'm willing to lick your fingers if you want. But not you, Tracksuit-sensei!
Ditching school on the second day. Going into house security mode. I gotta fix my room, the manufacturers are coming
It's hot. Getting sweaty~ Setting the AC to 18 degrees~
Wait, does this island have a convenience store?
Next week is the trip to Chofu. Last year we went to Tsukuba. It's been 3 years since we last went to Chofu
My torso hurts from moving heavy stuff yesterday. Dammit!
Remodeling is almost done
 I will be attending the panel discussion on the event stage at the Industry Robot Festival held on 7/6. On that day I will be on a trip to the Aichi factory so I will be appearing through a video call. Please invite your friends and stop by
From Robot Doctor. New parts are in. Hobby robot processor HHP0113 by RRR company in Taiwan. It's a new model released in May this year. Hard to find. First come first served
Uncle is usually calm, but when you get him mad he is extremely scary. Still I look up to him like a big brother. Started his own company HQed in Tanegashima and made it big. Truly amazing. Pride of the Nagafukadas
Tokyo media asked to interview my youngest daughter. It was cute watching her answer questions so nervously
Cleaning is annoying...
I thought there'd be tanned, muscular men on a tropical island, but I guess not
Today I have a trip to Tokyo. A bit of a rush: 3 days, 2 nights. Heading out
I-I'm gonna explain what just happened! I tried to organize my thin-books but I went into deep-reading mode and by the time noticed, 18 hours had passed
Y-You might not know what happened, but I don't know either. It wasn't something cheap like hypnosis or super speed. I experienced a part of something way more scary
 The Exoskeleton Company is currently running a campaign to celebrate three million HUG Series units sold. During the campaign period, everyone who buys the HUG-06 KARUMA, introduced today, will get 10,000 yen cash back. Please contact official dealers for further details
Off to sleep \(^o^)/
Summer is the season where people get all heated up. Either it's love or dreams. Young ones, would you like to fly through the clear blue sky? I will help you get there
Recently, I've been having stomach pain. Must be from all the stress
@TIDELINE-EIGHT If you're offering to help, how about helping me? Buy a frying pan on your way home. Ours broke
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Of course, my lovely wife. Is a teflon-covered one OK?
Some weirdo came to visit, but of course couldn't enter my invincible fortress! 2ez
Speaking of, a friend of mind once said that a fortress that didn't let anyone in is impressive, but a soldier that never successfully invaded you can't count on or something like that. Means, virgins are the strongest. I get it
@UMISHO Hurry and come home
@UMISHO Where are you?!
@UMISHO Dinner is going to get cold!
@UMISHO I won't cook anymore if you are not going to eat!
@UMISHO Mom is worried. You must be embarrassed about spending time with the family. Someday even that will be a memory. So don't be embarrassed and dive into Mom and Dad's love
From Robot Doctor. New parts are in. I got in Hekatonkheir, a unique controller from Germany's Schwartz Robotel released in 2013. A product that was said no one could use to its full potential. Come get it if you are confident in your skills
Back from the business trip. I tried a little to talk to many people
A ghost ey. Do they even really exist. I don't have senses so I don't even know
Regarding the Exoskeleton Company accident, it is a very unfortunate that such an accident occurred
Is Exoskeleton, Misaki-chan's company? I wonder if she is ok
HUG is in trouble? Some robot doctor could have maybe fixed it. Need the people of ExCo to do maintenance correctly, from the user's side that's not cool
@UMISHO Son! Where are you?! I'm going to lock the house so you can't get in!
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA All men experience a need in their youthful days to spend alone time staring quietly up at the stars
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
To Exoskeleton Company product users and those who have been following this account. Regarding the news that is being reported, we are currently investigating into the situation so I am unable to tweep on this account. Thank you for your understanding
Hello from Space Candy! Our delicious mint-flavor candy, Space Candy, is currently on sale in the Kyushu area!
Uncle has a great vision as a business man. I don't get it at all
Today was a test run for the plastic bottle rocket a young worker F-kun made. It was a success and flew about 50 meters. The team gave a big cheer
We would like to launch a real rocket into space too
Geez, this is annoying. The Vice principal dropped the hammer. But it's not like we got complaints at the school. I think it's a family problem so why do I, the supervisor, have to get scolded?
 Oops, should zip my lips. That's the best way to go lol
Hello from Space Candy! Just found a candidate for our company's campaign girl. Thinking about ways to expand public relations. Oh, before that I have to officially scout her!
 Yeah! It's Summer BREAK! Listen up, if students are on summer break, then so are their teachers! Remember that!
Kids are starting summer break tomorrow. It would be nice if a lot of tourist families visit the island
Technicians working at JAXA are all basically otakus of certain subjects. People like that love to talk about whatever projects they're involved in
Especially stories about rockets and space, kids love them
@UMISHO Don't start staying out as soon as it's summer break! Isn't it your last summer as a high schooler? Why don't you spend it wisely
I feel bad for Senomiya. She should take a vacation and come back to the island. If so I'll let her treat me out. Since if she's on TV that much, she must have a lot of money
 Get treated out by the ones who make it big. Think of it as a promo gift
At TNSC we hold a facility tour every day. It is summer break, so come visit with your family!
Hm? We have a Pleiades in our club
Geez. Their eyes have no ill will. Kids these days...
From Robot Doctor. New parts are in. World's first battery for giant robots, the 45D-01 by Matoba Technical Research Institute. The battery is made for giant robots, but basically it's a smaller car battery. Have two in stock
Due to the current situation, I will be stepping away from media appearances. I will also be taking a break from this account as well. I will be putting my everything into my position. Please continue to support Exoskeleton Company
Hello from Space Candy! Space Candy now sponsors Chuo Tanegashima High Robotics Club! Today for the first time I saw parts for the giant robot and it really is big
I wasn't the only one hearing Kagome Kagome play, right
Regarding the Kagome Kagome incident—was it a technical issue or something? I wonder...
I think something was ringing now that you mention it, but isn't it easier to just ignore it?
Due to Typhoon #6, Japan Air Connect Kagoshima to Tanegashima will be canceled. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused
Hello from Space Candy! Typhoons have serious impact!
@UMISHO Hurry and come home, a typhoon is here. Quit wandering around!
For days like this, there's nothing better than drinking!
Last night in Tanegashima was a disaster from the typhoon. Had some trouble like the neighbor's son went missing, but glad that he was okay after all
@TNSC_SENOMIYA Sorry for the trouble our son has caused. Thank you for the help
@TIDELINE-EIGHT No problem. Our younger daughter always needs help too. The feeling is mutual
The Robotics Club has been more vigorous lately. Must be feeling giddy from all that money. Kids these days...
Business trip to Tanegashima! Second day here, but already getting baptized~!
Storms in tropical areas are different than Tokyo. They're tough. I guess that's what you call nature's wrath. For some reason, I got super excited. Total adrenaline rushヽ(゜ ▽ ゜)ノ
Tanegashima has lots of small hills which was quite surprising. As a biker, each hill itself wasn't so bad, but all those hills in a row were super annoying. I don't know how many times I cried inside thinking what's the point of climbing up if we're just gonna go down again...
@SISTER_BRAUN Didn't think you'd bring your bike to the island
@TNSC_SENOMIYA Heheh, Sayaingen is my partner
That boy probably won't come back home till late tomorrow. Just enjoy your day at the festival
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA We should go to the festival too. I can accompany you since I don't have a flight
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
Hello from Space Candy! We will have a booth at the Yoira~Iki Festival! There will be venue-limited Space Tornado Candy there, so don't miss it!
I received a call from a young girl. Seems like she is from JAXA and is coming to school to have a talk. Is she really from JAXA? Tbh, I want to go to the festival. Make it quick
Excited for the fireworks♪
From Robot Doctor. Got in some new parts. Shinden Tech's Moebius Coil. This one is rare. How about using it for a wireless power supply? Got 3 in stock. First come first served
Hello from Space Candy! Planning a super impactful announcement regarding Chuo Tanegashima High Robotics Club! Stay tuned!
Yeah, the plan is set! It is going to be splendid! We will be announcing our company's campaign girl! Going to have Nannichi Newspaper come for an interview! I wonder if nation-wide press will come too
It's finally sunny!
Excited for the test run♪
Sponsored by Space Candy Co., Ltd. Chuo Tanegashima Robotics Club's Giant Robot GunBuild-1 Presentation and Test Run to be held today!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Wow! It's your birthday! Congrats! This is the perfect day for our company's campaign girl, who's also the pilot for a giant robot, to debut!
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN Happy Birthday!
The giant robot started by my older daughter and taken over by the younger daughter seems to have finally been completed. I would like to see it, but can't due to work... It's a shame, but I will be supporting them from work
What went wronnngggg! We can't end like thisss!
Well, it's amazing that they even completed it. Even though it only took 2 steps, it still walked. Isn't that amazing? I can't believe it
The force of the giant robot was amazing! I want it to walk more next time! Keep at it, high schoolers!
I was so desperate to calm down Uncle that I forgot to eat
Failure leads to success. Boys grow up through making many mistakes until they become an adult. Keep your head up, young man. The wings of opportunity are just ahead of you
It's Obon, but I won't be able to come home this year. Sorry, Dad > <
I thought he'd be feeling down, but I guess not. Our son may be surprisingly tough
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Maybe my advice worked
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
What is youth? Youth is like a spring breeze drifting over the ocean. Now, fly away by spreading your wings. The dream you are chasing is across the ocean
Why do I have to standby at the teacher's office on a Sunday? We use to let the kids manage themselves and it was fine. Beyond bored
Model-1 has room for improvement. Just tweaking it a bit would make it better. Think about the looks later. Kids these days don't know when to quit
This is an exciting, nerve-racking day!
When I see youngsters trying so hard, it reminds me of when I was 20 years younger. Lots of energy here at Tanegashima Space Center
Hello from Space Candy! I just heard something exciting! They're letting me have just a bite of it!
However, don't bite your candy. Suck on 'em
Tsk, seems like my eyes have dulled... Might be time to call it quits
Anno Potatoes are sooo sweet! <3 They're sweeter than sweet potatoes! And they are rich! It'd be amazing to have these in winter~
Hello from Space Candy! The Gun Festival is happening today in Nishinoomote-shi! Space Candy will be there too, so drop by to check out the matchlock gun experience!
The reactions of the kids on this island are so pure that it makes me feel happy talking to them. They say hello even though they don't know you. Feels nice to be here♪
@TIDELINE-EIGHT I should give up hoping that he'll go to college seeing how he's put his everything into club activities. Usually now's the time you should be studying
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA At times boys must prioritize their dreams and passion over stability
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA I wrote it as boys but please read it as men just so you know
@TIDELINE-EIGHT You say that, but it doesn't seem that way. I would agree if he showed as much passion as Akiho-chan does
There's a student in the club who's way richer than me. I wish they'd share some with me. At least pay me for helping with the move
Local public workers have it rough
@DAITOKU_JUNJUN If I was even a little bit of help, I am super happy! Let's talk again♪
The kids on the island are really pure. Things were tougher in Tokyo for me during junior high and high school
Recently heard a girl's voice say “Big Brother” in my son's room. I hope it's not haunted by a ghost. A bit worried
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Boys going through puberty always have things they wish to hide from their parents. I don't think we should worry about it, my lovely wife
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
The public opening of Tanegashima Space Center has come to an end. It was full of families who traveled a long way. We received warm words from our older, passionate fans who we hope will return to see rockets launching again soon. Thank you very much!
The final episode? The miraculous, final episode? I didn't think I'd ever see it in my lifetime!
NOOOOOOoooooo!!! Sayaingen got a flat tireee ><
@UMISHO Today was a great help. Thank you. Let's get some games in again♪
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Hrm?! Son is acting a little weird. Something's up. Maybe he'll study more... or not
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA You get that feeling of ennui at the end of summer. Not just boys, all students feel it. I call it “Lost summer syndrome”
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA One summer's adventure is just a mirage. Stinging, burning love belongs to the inaccessible world of TV dramas. Youthful passion—its hope turns into despair and makes you want to cry
@TIDELINE-EIGHT How about you instead buy some milk on the way back?
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Leave it to me, my lovely wife. Is the usual low-fat milk OK?
@UMISHO You are strong. The Flat-Out Princess blood in me is boiling
I don't want to be in reckless mode. Oh, I call it reckless mode because when I concentrate and play games I go emotionless. Hence Flat-Out Princess. It kinda embarrasses me ><
I hope I won't scare this island's male students
Can we have an extra month for summer break
Who wouldn't go into the ocean in the tropics?! Tropical beaches with no one around are amaze-balls! I brought a swimsuit just for it! (I came prepared to play...)
I'm confident in my looks since I work out. Ripped abs! Muscles on my biceps! Pretty good for a girl. Hehehe~
Oh but I don't mean it like I'm a musclehead or anything! I just have good amount of muscle!
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Kaito looks like he's feeling down. He doesn't eat much. Really easy to notice
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Love makes people change. I grew as a person by marrying you. I'm truly grateful to you, my lovely wife
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Oh really?
Sighhhhhhh, I got the August Bluessss
Tokyo feels more humid than Tanegashima. The atmosphere here is also a little tense. I really feel it after experiencing the mellowness of Tanegashima. Oh and the sky is also pretty narrow
Hello from Space Candy! The Chuo Tanegashima High Robotics Research Club's Gunvarrel pilot is a square-type young man! But he lacks some impact!
Showed the First Osaki Office to the members of the local robot research club
From the proposal of wanting to create a giant robot to the efforts of our young worker T-kun, they were able to get an approval from HQ. Since TNSC currently has no plans to launch a rocket, we would like to provide more opportunities to young kids like this
@TNSC_SENOMIYA Ohh, were they happy about it?
@SISTER_BRAUN It was charming to see my daughter's “Come at me” face
Old soldiers aren't needed, huh? I thought I was a tougher old man... Sigh, I guess I can have some free-range chicken and sake!
Maybe I'll hit the arcades to loosen up a bit♪
Hm? Thinking about it, the club members haven't come to pick up the club room keys recently. Wonder what they're doing
Boys have times when they need to do it. Flying from the runway or just standing there, the action you take decides if you can make it beyond the sky
You probably know by now, but you read boys as men
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Rather than that, can you buy soap?
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA No problem, my lovely wife
Rode from Chofu to Akihabara on the bike. It was easy since there weren't small ups and downs like in Tanegashima. But riding in Tokyo is stressful because of all the cars. I didn't use to care before though
Looks like it only took a month for my body to get used to the atmosphere on the island
Yesterday, students were enthusiastically watching the footage I took. Finally there are students who understand the hardships of being a cameraman at events. You feel my recording skills right, I get it
 The most important thing about recording footage is to keep the camera running
From Robot Doctor. We are scheduled to start business here at the Robot Clinic. Come say hello
Did a small craft project. Came out decent considering I just finished healing up. It was good rehab knowing I still got it
I got a birthday gift from the kids on the island! So happy! I'll keep it safe!
This morning, I received a birthday gift from my younger daughter. It kind of made me shy, seeing her so shy as she handed me the gift. I teared up. Makes me feel like I aged a bit
@TNSC_SENOMIYA It's nice cuz girls are so thoughtful. Boys are usually a little rough and don't care about the details so I haven't received a gift before. But I still love my son of course
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Kaito-kun is an amazing young man, always looking out for our daughter. I'm sure he's acting shy toward his own father. I know because I was like that when I was young
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON What do you mean you are gonna take over, you still got 30 more years to go! Come back again! I still ain't ready to let the young ones take over!
I messed up. But I'm not gonna just sit here and wait. Gonna keep going
If that solar storm hit a flying plane, would it crash?
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Are you ok?
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Don't worry, my lovely wife. Depending on the situation, they will cancel the flights tomorrow
Dad... I hope you're ok...
I hope that whole ISS story is fake...
Are my friends in Tokyo ok? Might be in a pretty bad situation
What a big impact. I don't mind sending Space Candy for support but is Tanegashima even ok in the first place?
Robots are rebelling? What's going on? It's like a movie
It's like we're in an anime. And in a negative way. This just makes robots look worse. Can we not stop it?
Kogoori is the one behind all this? What?
Maybe I should stop selling parts for a bit and concentrate on the building aspect. I feel much better since I got the surgery
Damn it, testing period ended and it's back to the regular schedule. Goodbye, paradise
Even in Tanegashima it's cold in the winter. I thought it was the same as Okinawa and would be like summer. Though if you think about it, we are 500 kilometers away from Okinawa so it's natural that it's a different temp
I asked Dad about the situation in Tokyo. It looks like it's calming down little by little. He said life is a little inconvenient since electronics don't work and there are more accidents
I'm a little scared about flying. I don't know if another solar storm will happen. As captain, I must think about the safety of my passengers first, so now I fly on the wings of death. But I know I won't die. I refuse to leave behind my loving wife and beautiful son
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Rather than that, can you buy some sweet potatoes on the way back?
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Of course, my lovely wife
As we announced during our press release, HUG is fully protected against solar storms. There are no chances that it will malfunction
It has passed our company's extensive safety tests and has received a 4/5 from the industrial robot safety standards in the EU. Please continue your support of the Exoskeleton Company
We are also continuing our research about any relationships involving the accidents. We will provide any details at a later date
Lately, my son has been leaving the house much earlier. I wonder if the robotics club started morning meet ups too?
Hello from Space Candy! PokeComs have been acting up recently. More than half the employees have experienced something. Is it due to the solar storm?
Every year, I make sure the Christmas cake gets sent overseas. Isn't it romantic? It's my way of putting on a show. I'm sure my lovely wife and son like it
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Yes yes, about the cake, I preordered it at Le Ciel in Nakatane. The neighbor Ishi-san told me about it
Seems like my wife doesn't want to trouble me. I guess I'm going home empty handed
I will be staying on the island for Christmas and the holiday season. I'm really sorry that I can't come back Dad!
@AKIPOPOPOPOOON I feel the same way! If we started break before Christmas, we would have so much fun! Both teachers and students!
Hello from Space Candy! How about some Space Candy with your cake and champaign for Christmas? You can get the special Christmas version at the B-COOP inside Kagoshima now
 Robotics club, at least take Christmas off. Taking breaks every so often helps regenerate your minds and bodies
I have a dinner date with all the female employees tomorrow♪
I bought a PokeCom for a longtime female friend, but I wonder if she can even use it to its full capacity? She'll probably only use it as a phone because she hates machines, even though I went out of the way to buy it when she finally gave in
We have an emergency meeting in the morning today! I'm so hype right now!
It's finally done. They really did it in such a short amount of time. Kids these days...
It's been 8 years. My dream of being the first president of the club was fulfilled in my second year after being a supervisor. I helped raise the current members. Way to go first president!
Wah I'm gonna be late to the meeting! ><
@M_NAGAFUKADA Is the Space Candy logo on Model-2?! Please comfirm!
Hello from Space Candy! I suggested a presentation show for robot Model-2, but they told me no this time. Looks like the first presentation will be at the Expo. But the craftmanship of Model-2 deserves to be shown on a big stage like that! It has amazing impact!
This is a very sudden development, but after 5 years, TNSC has decided to launch a rocket. The request came from a private enterprise (the details of which will be announced very soon)
Due to last November's solar storm, all scheduled rocket launches have been delayed. Because of the delays, the launch schedule has been pushed back. Thus, an overseas private enterprise has requested TNSC to make a launch
At JAXA, we think it is a waste to keep the equipment at TNSC left unused, so why not let a private enterprise use it. There may be more cases like this in the future
Much of this process is a first for us, but all the team members are excited about the rocket's launch, depsite the busy production schedule. We will have more details soon
Oh you're launching a rocket? Maybe I'll go watch you guys again
A rocket is the only thing on Earth that can fly past my wings and into the heavenly world. Higher than god's throne. It's very romantic
@TIDELIDE-EIGHT Rather than that, can you get some toilet paper on the way back?
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Leave it to me, my lovely wife. Is the regular two-ply OK?
Even though we hassled them a bit, the students agreed to our request with big smiles. The kids on the island are all really nice. I want to help them as much as I can
I did something bad to my daughter and her friends. It was security protocol, but we had to kick them out... But my daughter still rooted for me. That was such a relief. I promised that we will both try our best
Leaving in the middle of the night during the winter. I'm worried my son is turning into a bad boy
Huh? I'm supposed to go drinking with Irei but the call isn't connecting. Where is she?
Geez, as expected, she can't use all the PokeCom's features
Hello from Space Candy! We are stepping up production of the scheduled rocket launch date!
Rocket launch schedule made by AeroSphere Company in America. Unlike the H-ⅡA Rocket, this one is quite simple and will only take a month to complete
AeroSpace Company also referenced the H-ⅡA Rocket's measurements so the size of the launch pad is almost exactly the same
I guess I'll go take a look at the robot tomorrow since it's here at the old airport. As an ex-member of NASDA, it felt awkward showing my face at TNSC
Where did Irei go? She's not even calling back. I can't pick up the proteins that I ordered with an IOU
An unacceptable accident happened during my daughter's club meet. Accidents are accidents. No ill will was involved. However, I'm very disappointed since this could have been prevented if an adult was supervising
Sorry if it seems I wasn't supervising properly... I apologize that we couldn't continue to support you well enough...
@UMISHO If you're feeling bad, you should go talk to someone. It doesn't have to be me if you don't want. At least it wasn't your fault
@EXOSKELETON_SENOMIYA Irei's funeral went well. I know you couldn't come because you're busy with work. Please at least send some prayers into the skies from Tokyo
@EXOSKELETON_SENOMIYA HUG is kinda scary. Please figure out how to deal with this. This kinda accident can't happen again. Counting on you
@M_NAGAFUKADA @AKIPOPOPOPOOON @UMISHO Did you land yet? I'll be waiting at the venue!
Tokyo has changed compared to last year. Feels like it's more restless. I don't like this atmosphere
This time, it's coordinated perfectly. The man who can learn from his last mistakes, me, Nagafukada Mitsuhiko
@UMISHO At least let me know if you got to Tokyo! Make sure you support Akiho-chan!
I should've gone to Tokyo too. It's not a good sign to think this way. Maybe I'm a little emotional. I'm just a bunch of broken parts in the end
Fortunately, my will to build doesn't know when to stop so I guess I'll dive into that
Hm? Where did everyone leave Model-2? Are they in the venue?
I have to go on a business tip. I know it will be lonely by yourself but it will only be for a short while, my lovely wife. I love you. Going to go now
Kaito-kun, Akiho-chan, good luck!
Oh, the Expo starts today? I shouldn't be doing the laundry!
Hello from Space Candy! It's time to show off the giant robot made in Tanegashima, GunBuild-2, featuring Space Candy. Space Candy fans in Tokyo, come to Odaiba if you want to see the shining Space Candy logo!
The Expo broadcast is on! But the Robotics Club is nowhere to be seen
Either way, I think Little Senomiya is a better club President now
Construction has finally come to an end. Depending on the weather on March 2nd, it looks like we can launch a rocket for the first time in 5 years
What is going on in Tokyo. Is the Robotics Club ok?!
This is horrible...
This has to be a lie
I'm fine!
Everyone please come home safe
Where is Mitsuhiko wandering around!
My senses tell me this smells very fishy
Looks like my workmanship is going to be needed
My husband, son, and Akiho-chan are all safe! Thank you to everybody who was worried
I will never, ever get lost. My flying was perfect this time too. Even though we're taking a different route than usual, I promise to come back to the island. This is my home. I promise that no matter what happens
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Rather than that, can you buy as many radish and taro as you can at B-COOP!
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA Goodness gracious, I spoil you far too much, my lovely wife. Regardless, copy that
Can't just be scared and evacuate. Gotta learn from my husband and kids!
Please come quickly
Started seeing some feathers. Inside ‘IRUO.’ A lot of feathers were flying and it was very pretty
Don't have enough time. Gotta work it out somehow
You have the weight of Space Candy on your shoulders, do your best Robotics Club!
@TIDELINE-EIGHT Looks like they're going soon. I hope they're ok
@FUMIKO_TANEGASHIMA I don't know the details, but the fate of the world is on our son's shoulders. Let's send him off proudly. There are times when boys have to fight
It's ok to read “Boys” as “Men”
I'm not ready to die, damn it! I and all the students will come back alive. So I won't prepare for my death! You got it, Senomiya Misaki?! Irei is really pissed at you in heaven!
This is sad. Until a couple days ago, all the workers were excited about the first rocket launch in 5 years but now we are trying to prevent it
But we will not let them launch the rocket! And we promised to save the director! That is the will of the TNSC workers!
Phew, I thought it was getting rowdy outside but didn't know this was going on. Robots going haywire. I'll just come out and say it, nice delusions bro lolol fuhihi lolol
Go outside and face reality? Why would I do that? Do you have brain damage? Don't you know it's dangerous outside? I'll just stay inside and play eroge all day instead
Seriously the robots going haywire is a delusion becoming reality. Whose delusion is this?? Listen carefully, there's a person gifted with Gigalomania. They can make delusions into reality. I used to be a Gigalomaniac too
I'm sure the real culprit who made the robots go nuts is coming for me. Why do they always come for me! Yes, I get that my extravagant delusions have the power to change the world and all but at the end of the day I'm just a NEET in my late 20s. This sucks...
Hey, who's the bastard who @'d me saying, “Nice delusions, bro”? Damn it, all of you should just die! I'm telling the truth! The Shibuya destruction that happened 10 years ago was because of this stuff! Believe me, you imbeciles! Who do you think saved the world?! It was me, goddammit!
Ah, got to watch Magical Girl Erin Strikehomerun. I didn't think Blood-Tune would last this long, fuhihi, but Erin is a timeless loli! 2D is the best!!!
I don't have any interest in 3D. And Koujiro Frau is a fujoshi, right? Male otakus and fujoshis cannot get along. Some people think they're both just otakus so it'll be fine. How incredibly naive...
Fujoshis don't know when to compromise compared to otaku men and they have far greater delusions than us. I understand that I have an extraordinary delusional power, but even then I can't beat their delusions. (Mainly the sexual ones)
Do you know how many times ive had to suffer? When you get involved with a fujoshi they just destroy your pride as an otaku. Every time. Just thinking about it gives me the chills
Don't get involved with fujoshis, you hear me?! If you do, you'll just become another victim like me! Whenever they're around you, they're always stripping off your clothes and doing all sorts of weird stuff to you in their heads! That's why you have to stay away!!!
Planning to stay inside and play old eroge on Christmas Eve. Christmas will be the usual, marathoning Blood Tune from morning to night
Looks like there are protests to cancel Christmas, but wouldn't that just mean marching down the lit up streets while normie couples laugh at you or something? What kind of torture is that lmao
People who are part of the protest must be insane masochists or unpopular normies looking for attention. I will never participate. Never
Rather than being part of the protest, isn't it more romantic to spend it with cute 2D girls inside a warm and cozy house? There's no need to go outside. That's right, us unpopular souls have 2D, and 2D will never betray us!
Lightning-Fast Neidhardt-shi is going to stay in and play old eroge. I respect and love that! Neidhardt doesn't change at all. I want him to stay the way he is!
I used to spend Christmas Eve like that until around 3 years ago, so for the last couple years I've spent Christmas with my family
Ah, I won't be hurt by the words “Probably spent with your parents,” or anything like that. I savor virgins being envious of me, lol. gg no re
After all, the family I'm talking about is my wife and daughter lolololol I'm a normie lololol
I just received some devastating news... How could this be? DaSH, have you betrayed us?! I will never forgive this...!
The envy of man is truly unseemly. Well, my wife is an ex-cosplayer and she accepts my eroge hobby. My 2yr old daughter takes after me so she's ultra cute!! I give her a bath every day. I really am a father now. Men truly grow stronger when they have a family. We grow mentally, too
Just a hunch, but that “wife and daughter” of yours are probably imaginary existences
Oh, Neidhardt-shi, when did we fall apart so? Was it pride, or perhaps our difference in circumstances?
I-I have tons of girlfriends! We're so close that I've smelled one of their armpits, forced one to say “cock-a-doodle-doo,” one stepped on my crotch, one forced me to do puppy play, one sucked on my fingers, and one's even my actual little sister!!!
All these people are completely brainless. 3D is no good. That's why I don't see any of my girlfriends and stay huddled up in the 2D world on Christmas. That's my way of life. Fuhihi
I hosted a house party for my family and some friends. Its been a dream of mine for so long. After all, you're a winner at life if you host a house party, everyone knos that
It makes you feel like you're the real backbone of the family, like you're saying “Welcome to my castle, now please, sit and enjoy my hospitality.” Have I already become a total normie?
This is an article from a while back, but I heard a little girl who was in a coma for 10 years was recently discovered. My delusions are running wild
I mean, if cold sleep becomes common, I could legally marry a younger girl, right?!
C'mon am I wrong? If you freeze a 10 year old girl for 10 years, you get a 20 year old loli because her body stops growing! Holy SHIIIIIT! A revolution is gonna happen in 3D lolol It's the dawn of 3D!!! lolol
Lightning-Fast Neidhardt-shi is preaching about dreams for an otaku and I absolutely agree! Legal loli is the Utopia that all men—all warriors strive for, everyone knows that! No one will be able 2 judge you anymore!
What? Why would I ever lay my hands on my own daughter? She is my angel! I won't let anyone touch her. I won't allow any dirty hands to touch her...!
Wait, but doesn't that mean me, too?! I have dirty hands! What do I do?!? That means I can't have my relaxing bath time with my daughter anymore!! NoooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Neidhardt and DaSH, could you not? If you're gonna continue spewing out your nonsensical delusions I will crack your heads open and jam electrodes in there. I can't believe you're both still acting like this at your ages...
I think it'll take a while until a cold sleep machine would be available. The biggest risk comes when you detoast
Ah, it's defrost! Screwed up, fml...
I think it's possible to place someone in cold sleep with recent scientific advancements, but the hard part is thawing. You would have to do human experimentation and then find out what kind of results you get
I'm pretty sure if you went to recruit test subjects that there'll be tons all around the world. I think it's tech that's really desired but scientists have morals and refuse to move forward with the tech bc of that. It's the same as blaspheming God
Bsides, if the source is SpoEast, it's likely 99% fake. I mean, the tester was a beautiful little girl. Stuff like this isn't a fairy tale or some otaku's delusions, you know. Q.E.D.
Can the Kimijima Reports be an SOS from a cute 2D loli who lives in cyberspace and when you collect them all you unlock an H scene with her or something like that? If so, I will pour all my heart and soul into it. Haven't done that in a while, fuhihi
But not for you, 3D, I'll never accept you! I'm only interested in 2D. My sense of honor barely allows up to 2.5D
Are there people who are actually trying to set the flags for the Kimijima Reports? I just hacked in2 and analyzed all of them but they didn't have anything interesting on em
Those Kimijima Reports seems kinda like viruses so I dont think they should be spread around too much. If something gets snuck in the data, all the PokeComs in the world will be infected and it'll be a disaster
Aaah, the writing style in the Kimijima Reports reminds me of my old acquaintance. How that endearing idiot talked was very similar to Kimijima. It makes my head spin
This recent outbreak of the same chuunibyou as him is becoming a pandemic. The reports feel like a real "nice conspiracy theory, bro" moment tbh
If I were to comment on it, I'd say that the reports are completely missing the details regarding the specific method employed to actually trigger the magnetic substorm. Y'know, one of the most important parts of a whistleblowing piece? smh
Cute girl robots >>> giant robots. That's just common sense! A life-size maid robot! Hurry up and make them, don't blame me for what happens otherwise! And of course the boobs have to be the softest possible, so account for that. No problem. Everything's fine.
But a giant maid robot would be acceptable too. There was an old eroge like that. That one was reaaal lewd fuhihi. If it's 10m high and replicated the female body closely, it'd depend on the price but I would def buy at least 3 of them
Life-size maid robot (special service ok) is a man's dream, duh! Wife? Daughter? Sure I've got both, but what does that matter?!
The reason science and technology have gotten this far is because of the military and the power of ero! If you have time to make a giant robot, make a cat-ear maid robot first! Would be best at 140cm high
At any r8, short, tig bittied cat-ear maids were my idols during the prime of my youth. 2ez
That's why I'm repping the Orienty Industry!
Ugh, Hashida and Nishijou act like the biggest dumbasses whenever they're yapping about something. Why do men possess this extreme hope for life-size female robots? Besides, Hashida's got a wife and kid
Oh, dear, I exposed their real names to the masses. What a truly reprehensible occurence 
There's a wall between 2D and 3D that can never be ascended. 3D has no room for delusions, and while 2D is ideal, you still can't touch them. You need to wake up. It's a mistake to expect 3D to be the same as 2D
So, this Expo, what I'm personally interested in is the brainwave control system by PsychoTechMachine Company. It's WIP, but it can connect the will of the pilot to a robot far better than the master-slave OS does.
However, if you use the software for too long, you run the risk of losing the ability to distinguish between your body and the robot's, which causes extreme dissonance in the brain. This can seriously affect the subject's mental state. Further research is required
All my girlfriends are here at my house for some reason. Alright, fine, guess I'll go out for a little bit...
I don't want to go out in this chaos... What did I do to deserve this...? Why me...?
This isn't the time to laze around and gorge myself on pizza!
There was a call for all the labmems. Seems like Operation Laevateinn is about to commence. Time to use my title as Super Hacker and figure out whats going on!
To protect my wife and daughter, daddy is going to try very hard!
I'm still unbelievably frustrated that I'm still in America. I want to be back in Japan already, but there are no flights running. Plus, America's having a crisis right now
I hope my friends in Japan are safe...
I would like to share a good luck charm you can say in times like this to anyone watching
El Psy Kongroo. It doesn't really mean anything, but when you say it, it somehow calms you down. Give it a shot, sometime
There's no response from Sister Centipede. Does that mean...?
I didn't think I would get a request as DaSP instead of DaSH. It's been many many years, but it seems its time for me to break out the big guns
Oh, DaSP is short for “Daru the Super Programmer.” This'll be on the test. I'm so OP
Oh, Nae is in Tanegashima. She'll take care of it. It'll be alright, I'm sure of it
WcDonald's is aiming to automate. 20% of the stores will have robots run the registers #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0610xx_
I've never seen a robot worker. It has to be an urban legend #TABOO_NEWS
There are more in the suburbs because they still want to use humans in the busier areas >automation #TABOO_NEWS
Shinagawa was the first one to introduce them. The first day was so crowded that it was a huge mess #TABOO_NEWS
Solar storm news for 6/11. Small solar flares can be seen on the surface of the sun but they are relatively calm
How long do auroras last? Will the night sky stay red for decades to come? I want them to disappear cause they look creepy #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Why aren't convenience stores interested in adapting robots? #TABOO_NEWS
Maybe because there's more to do at a convenience store? There's like shopping and other tasks to do #TABOO_NEWS
Tokyo has really increased their number of service robots #TABOO_NEWS
There are no realistic-looking robots yet. Real robots and sexaroids are still a dream of a dream #TABOO_NEWS
First of all, implementing robots takes away jobs from humans. Why would you cut work when the unemployment rate is at its worst. Is the government stupid? #TABOO_NEWS
I think Tokyo is pushing it hard. It has to be related to the Expo happening next year. I mean the number of service robots increased a lot within just 2 years #TABOO_NEWS
Red auroras can only be seen in low latitude areas. In Hokkaido you can see a half green and red one. I think auroras can keep appearing cuz it doesn't get pitch dark at night #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
The auroras themselves have no actual harm. I couldn't care less #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
When I pass a robot that's walking through the city, it scares me. They have cute designs, but there's this physical pressure. They're big you know #TABOO_NEWS
I think it's ok because it's kinda romantic #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Eyes are scary #TABOO_NEWS
You'll get used to it right? It's gonna be normal to see robots one day #TABOO_NEWS
U.S. Robocom released a self-driving car at beginning of this year. The one with the man-shaped navigation system on the dashboard. I don't want to ride those. Don't want to put my life in a machine's hand #TABOO_NEWS
Next year, Aqualiner will be on full-auto to match the opening of the Expo. Seems like there will be a navi robot in the driver's seat #TABOO_NEWS
Auroras are romantic if you see them from time to time but I'm tired of them since they come out every single night. Tbh as a person who lives in the countryside it makes me mad that we can't see the stars more #TABOO_NEWS
Train automation has already been done by Yurikamome. Maybe you have robot allergies if you're rejecting a robot in the driver's seat? #TABOO_NEWS
The fascination of Senomiya Misaki (Exoskeleton Company) who grabs older men's hearts #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/0611xx_
Misaki-san was beautiful today too #ZACOZACO
She has a charm that idols don't. I think she's PR for a regular company. I'm saying that amateurs are pretty amazing #ZACOZACO
Her manners and tone are so calm that she has so much presence for a 24yo. I notice I call her Misaki-san, even though she's younger than me #ZACOZACO
I naturally call her Misaki-san too. She is the pretty, big sis you had delusions about in your younger days. Not even exaggerating #ZACOZACO
Misaki-san is like unsullied land to a farmer. A goddess #ZACOZACO
But aren't there times when she has a very cold look? Like when a comedian does a boring act. I'm not saying not to do it. Please look at me with those cold eyes more #ZACOZACO
Senomiya Misaki is super sadistic. That's a fact #ZACOZACO
She was saying she doesn't want to come out to PR that much. Her main job is as a test pilot #ZACOZACO
Did you see the AR in Odaiba? You can actually see Misaki-san in a tight HUG suit. Misaki-san's boobs are way big #ZACOZACO
It's all about the boobs #ZACOZACO
Gonna head to Odaiba for a min! #ZACOZACO
You can see it on ‘IRUO.’ without going there. It's tagged #ZACOZACO
‘IRUO.’ is a godly app for people living out in the country #ZACOZACO
I want to go shopping with Misaki-san at the Napuko store in Atsuta #ZACOZACO
What's so great about HUG? Is there even a situation in your daily life that you need a power-assisted suit? I don't get how it sold 3,000,000 units #ZACOZACO
Thinking about it, I saw high school girls wearing HUGs in front of 107 in Shibuya. I didn't get it lol #ZACOZACO
There are people who wear HUG for fashion. I saw it on the news #ZACOZACO
I thought it was cool seeing grandpas and grandmas with weak legs and hips wearing HUGs and walking around Ginza #ZACOZACO
As a woman, I would like to say that if you wear it once it will change your world. Even though I'm healthy, I still wear mine every day. I even do physical labor now. You can pick up heavy items so easily, even things that macho-men have a hard time picking up #ZACOZACO
Sounds like an advertisement slogan #ZACOZACO
I understand the people who wear it for a reason, but not the people who wear it for fashion. It is fashionable, but it must be irritating #ZACOZACO
Just 10 years ago ExCo used to be a small-scale enterprise that barely sold 10 units a year, but now it's the #1 company students want to work at. Welfare and nursing care is the way to go in the world now. They're different from the companies making robots for fun #ZACOZACO
HUG isn't a robot. I get that it jumped on the robot boom, but I think it's wrong to put them in the same category #ZACOZACO
Senomiya Misaki is famous for winning ROBO-ONE in her high school days. Does anyone have pics or footage from it? I remember she looked really cute in her sailor uniform #ZACOZACO
Wasn't that like 7-8 years ago? ROBO-ONE was still in its start-up phase and wasn't getting a lot of attention. I don't think you'll find pics of the participants from back then #ZACOZACO
TAYOTA announces their newly developed robot, PrinceX #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0612xx_
Finally, TAYOTA of Japan has joined the robot boom. PrinceX is 8 meters high and is fueled by their electric-type engine. It really fits the concept of an ECO robot #TABOO_NEWS
TAYOTA really has joined the fight! CONDA has to think of something now #TABOO_NEWS
I think it's pretty big that they can use the inside-outs of an electric car. It's actually the world's first giant electric robot #TABOO_NEWS
It's a cute design, but since I'm used to seeing CONDA it feels a little awkward #TABOO_NEWS
tbh it was unexpected that TAYOTA joined the robot groups since they weren't really active in that scene #TABOO_NEWS
Why did they model it after a general design loved by everyone when they're a Japanese maker? Make a Gunbam! Gunvarrel is cool too! #TABOO_NEWS
Even if they made a real Gunbam, the legs would be too skinny and would be impossible to walk lolol Plus that thing is 18m high #TABOO_NEWS
Updated this weeks Kill-Ballad Leaderboard topics! #GGGGAME_COM #http://ggg.c/0615xx_
The top 3 are on such a diff level that it demotivates me #GGGGAME_COM
Where in the hell does Hanasono live? With the internet we have in 2019, there shouldn't be that much lag. I never get that much playing against someone from overseas #GGGGAME_COM
It scares me how few mistakes the top 3 make. I guess it just means you can't be on top unless you learn a lot. I'm just 4-digit ranker... #GGGGAME_COM
Takanoai and Umisho are the same type: idiots with good reactions #GGGGAME_COM
Calling world rank #1 and #5 idiots lolol #GGGGAME_COM
Umisho has his ups and downs. There are times when he makes mistakes. I got a game off him once but lost 3 times for it #GGGGAME_COM
Umisho hovers rank 5-10. He is the one to go for #GGGGAME_COM
Umisho doesn't play at night. Doesn't match my active time at all #GGGGAME_COM
High rankers are all just neets that only play games #GGGGAME_COM
I can't get Tagirin to crack. What am I supposed to do? They fight in a very unique way #GGGGAME_COM
Do you notice that sometimes Tagirin just stands there and has no guard up? I'd go in to pressure him, but get countered lolol #GGGGAME_COM
Tagirin must be taunting people. I never talked to them but it feels like they're looking down on me in a match. Umisho is the most human so I think better of him #GGGGAME_COM
What's up with how Frau Koujiro talks? It kinda pisses me off #GGGGAME_COM
Seems like it's the old flow from @channel #GGGGAME_COM
They're still rich with KB having over 20,000,000 downloads even though they're kind of an idiot. That's the definition of a winner. You've gotta fully envy it #GGGGAME_COM
I hope they'll let me join FRAUFAC!!!! #GGGGAME_COM
They made a high quality game by themselves? Of course they're a winner #GGGGAME_COM
Frau Koujiro is the only one who gets attention in FRAUKOUJIRO FACTORY, but I wonder who the other members are. It's some doujin group, right? #GGGGAME_COM
I heard they're a total of 5 members including Frau Koujiro #GGGGAME_COM
Hanjuro Hattori is on Twipo. Won't respond even though I talked to them #GGGGAME_COM
When I asked Maguyan they answered me politely. They're very nice #GGGGAME_COM
KB was a huge hit because it was cheap like doujins. But the quality of the game was better than a full-priced game too. Doesn't seem like the people at FrauFAQ care about making money. I think you'd break even at that price point #GGGGAME_COM
I'd buy it at double price. I mean itd only be 230 yen lol #GGGGAME_COM
I think it wasn't just because it was cheap. It worked well with the PokeCom. If smartphones didn't die and the PokeCom didn't get popular I don't think KB would've sold over 500,000 #GGGGAME_COM
On June 30th at 7pm, ROBO-ONE 41 Finals will be broadcasted! Who will be the one to stop Mr. Pleiades's 3-peat?! #FUJISUN_TV #http://fs.t/0616xx_
RO41 is at the Odaiba Expo Arena right? Is it the opening event? I need to go! #FUJISUN_TV
RO40 was the first NYE broadcast. The enegy level from the grand finals was unreal. But last year's event had crazy match ups which made it feel like a festival. I don't think it can beat that impact this year #FUJISUN_TV
Last year everyone had a different look on their face. It was a national-level event because it was broadcast from NYE. Of course you can't mess up and want to show your best during it all #FUJISUN_TV
Having over 20% views is spectacular. Back then they aired a fighting event at the time the big music festival was going on. I felt the same energy. I think I'll go to the venue for the first time #FUJISUN_TV
You'll know when you get there, but the ring is really small. I mean, it's a little dull since a 30cm robot is fighting 1v1. But you can only feel that vibe if you're at the venue. The energy level is ridiculous #FUJISUN_TV
Mr. Pleiades is entering this time too right? He's going to win again #FUJISUN_TV
The mysterious part of him is fantastic. Even as a guy I get the chills #FUJISUN_TV
Mr. Pleiades is some real gaybait, poor thing #FUJISUN_TV
He's good looking from the girls' side too♪ #FUJISUN_TV
Seems like FujisunTV is pushing Devil Stronger and Master Armor this year. Rumors are that they're done with Sato-maru #FUJISUN_TV
Whaaaat, I liked Sato-maru cuz it was cute looking! How are they cutting last year's winner? #FUJISUN_TV
I'm sure after losing 2 years in a row at finals to Mr. Pleiades no one would care about a nice old man. Having a new rival would make it more exciting #FUJISUN_TV
Devil Stronger is good as a rival, but if he wins I feel like female fans will go away lolol #FUJISUN_TV
Wait, are tickets sold out?! Can you still buy them at the venue the day of?! #FUJISUN_TV
Maybe for the preliminary rounds but for the finals you might need to line up very early in the morning #FUJISUN_TV
It's at the end of this month? What a weird time to host it this year. I wish they had it as soon as summer break started. Then I could've gone to Tokyo with my kids #FUJISUN_TV
The prelimary rounds for ROBO-ONE 41 will be at the Odaiba Expo Arena TODAY! Tomorrow, the finals will be live broadcasted on FujisunTV! Stay tuned! #FUJISUN_TV #http://fs.t/0629xx_
ROBO-ONE started huh! I heard there's a ton of participants #FUJISUN_TV
The number increases every year. I think it's over 400 people now? It's so overwhelming. You don't need to see the preliminaries if you don't know what's going on. Just watching the finals is enough #FUJISUN_TV
I'm a participant! I've been in line since yesterday for entry! I hope I can win the first round. Gonna do my best! #FUJISUN_TV
I have a problem with the “Only open-weight class” rule. I think they should bring back light weights. When a light weight goes against a heavy weight the matches go on longer #FUJISUN_TV
But it's more fun when a light beats a heavy #FUJISUN_TV
Hahaha! This tournament's winner will be me, Maekawa Shizuya and Devil Stronger! My adjustments are perfect! I've entered the preliminaries after getting top 16 last time, but with my current skill I will push my way to the finals! Hahahaha, too bad for everyone else! #FUJISUN_TV
Heavy weights have an advantage but judging by the robots that have entered it looks like there are quite a few light weights #FUJISUN_TV
Maekawa talks big, but he actually wins. Kinda pisses me off but have to accept it #FUJISUN_TV
I like how Maekawa-san fights cuz it's dynamic. Feels kinda American. It feels good watching cuz he is so... ooof
Maekawa should calm down a bit. He talks too much during the match, so annoying lol #FUJISUN_TV
In last year's finals tournament, Devil Stronger was the only one able to get 2 downs off Mr. Pleiades. It might happen again this year #FUJISUN_TV
ROBO-ONE 41, 32 candidates for the finals tournament have been decided. The major dark horse is the high school pair from Tanegashima #http://zs.o/0630xx_
I was at the venue yesterday and the Tanegashima Robotics Club was there? They were amazing! At the end Jay was only commentating on the Robotics Club's matches #ZANSPO
I mean they beat Devil Stronger, the biggest candidate to win this whole thing! #ZANSPO
It was just the preliminaries but the composure from the high schooler was unbelievable #ZANSPO
The finals' atmosphere is quite different. The preliminaries had over 400 contestants and the finals narrowed it to 32. The focus on each contestant is way different. There'll be more people watching now too. The pressure has to be crazy, especially for first-timers #ZANSPO
Senomiya Akiho-chan is cute. She has that simple country-side high school girl vibe! #ZANSPO
I mean she is Misaki-san's sister! Beautiful sisters from Tanegashima, that has to sell! They should both just debut in the show biz #ZANSPO
Hey, I was thinking about it but what was she doing during that match? Was she even needed? #ZANSPO
She was screaming out the ult move lolol Tanegashi something or other lol #ZANSPO
Maybe she's the mechanic? She relies on the guy to pilot is what I saw #ZANSPO
Was it 9 years ago that Senomiya Misaki won? At the time the venue was super small. And it was free to enter. I've been following ROBO-ONE since then and everyone got worked up seeing her sister enter #ZANSPO
What, Senomiya Misaki from ExCo? She's won ROBO-ONE before? I didn't know thattt #ZANSPO
Akiho-chan is cute. I think I like her more than Misaki-san #ZANSPO
Little Senomiya seems kinda dumb #ZANSPO
That machine Tanegashima Robotics Club built is a 10 year old robot. They just modified the one her sister Misaki was using. Speculation is that it has to be the lowest rank of the 32 finalists #ZANSPO
Wanna guess how far the Robotics Club will make it? I think they'll just win the first round #ZANSPO
The 1st round opponent for the Robotics Club is Mother. Just because they're a veteran doesn't mean they'll beat first-timers #ZANSPO
I want to watch a match against Mr. Pleiades, but they won't see each other in the grand finals. Oh well! #ZANSPO
You guys are all over Senomiya Misaki's sister, but the reason they beat Devil Stronger is because of the operator. He's something else #ZANSPO
Since Maekawa lost to that kid, there's no doubt that Mr. Pleiades will have a 3-peat. The high schoolers made it to the finals due to beginner's luck, they should be ok with just that #ZANSPO
Did you hear Pleiades-sama is the grandson of Ei-chan? It makes sense that he's related to a huge rockstar just from his aura #ZANSPO
I want to see a match between the Senomiya sisters! I wonder if Misaki-san will enter #ZANSPO
Whaaaattt Mother lost!!!! #ZANSPO
 Mother is out of the tournament. High schoolers from Tanegashima make it to the 2nd round #ZANSPO
Is Mother going to retire after this? #ZANSPO
I knew the Robotics Club was the real deal! They keep their cool even in the finals! The veteran Mother was getting so overwhelmed #ZANSPO
Wha, can it be, can that really happen? #ZANSPO
NinNin Rikishi self destructeddddd!!! Robotics Club won!!! #ZANSPO
NinNin Rikishi lost his concentration at the end. His bad habits shined through #ZANSPO
What! Yooo! The high school pair made it to top 8! #ZANSPO
Either that operator Yashio is crazy, or the robot's spec is amazing, but that reaction speed is crazy. There were so many times I questioned what I saw #ZANSPO
You got this far, just go all the way to grand finals, Tanegashima Robotics Club! You might be able to beat the one and only Mr. Pleiades! #ZANSPO
I get the vibe that a new hero is going to be born! #ZANSPO
ROBO-ONE Finals Tournament - Quarter Finals Match 2 Winner: TanegashiMachine 3 Custom - 2 downs Loser: Lovely Fairy - 3 downs #ZANSPO
Wooooooo they came back!!! Tanegashima! Amazing! #ZANSPO
Awwwww Lovely Fairy-chan!!! She lost!!!! #ZANSPO
TanegashiMachine was able to adapt to the speed of Lovely Fairy! They really aimed for that at the end! #ZANSPO
Dammit, how could you make our idol Lovely Fairy-chan cryyy?! I won't forgive you TanegashiMachine 3 Custom!! #ZANSPO
I've never seen a robot move like that at ROBO-ONE. It's not like it's super powers, they just react so fast after they see their opponent make a move. Reaction speed is amazing #ZANSPO
The boy from the Robotics Club looks like he isn't feeling well. I hope he's ok. They're winning but it really feels like it's always on the edge #ZANSPO
Semi-finals is against Sato-maru. How will they fight against a player that has experience winning the whole thing #ZANSPO
Sato-maru really wants to make it to grand finals. Lost to Mr. Pleiades the last 2 times in the grand finals. To get revenge he can't lose to these high schoolers #ZANSPO
I don't think Sato-maru will be able to win with the force they have. Young energy is extremely strong in moments like these #ZANSPO
I think the time for a generation change has come. It's gonna be the biggest turing point in ROBO-ONE history!! #ZANSPO
Geez, I'm already simulating the match between M45 and TanegashiMachine 3-kai in my head lolol #ZANSPO
Let's go, Robotics Club!!! #ZANSPO
ROBO-ONE 41 was held on the 30th at the Odaiba Expo Arena and Mr. Pleiades successfully achieved his 3-peat. #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0701xx_
That was a very weird ending lol #TABOO_NEWS
Ending with a self-destruct. I kinda laughed that that's what they did after the most exciting moment #TABOO_NEWS
I've been watching the finals match over and over since yesterday, but I still don't understand TanegashiMachine 3 Custom's movements #TABOO_NEWS
I guess the Robotics Club was still too green #TABOO_NEWS
That super reaction was crazy! I got the vibe it'd transform, but didn't expect THAT move! #TABOO_NEWS
Is transforming even ok in the first place? Rules-wise I mean. You don't get disqualified? #TABOO_NEWS
I mean it was already over when they did Tanegashi Accell Impact so I don't think the rules mattered lolol They didn't use it once until grand finals so it won't demote them #TABOO_NEWS
It was the most dumbfounded moment in the history of ROBO-ONE lolol #TABOO_NEWS
Even though he had super reactions and got a down from Mr. Pleiades he ends by ringing out with him. That boy Yashio can be quite an entertainer! #TABOO_NEWS
I have hopes for the Tanegashima Robotics Club for the next tournament. If they learn from this, there is a high chance that they can beat Mr. Pleiades #TABOO_NEWS
I can't even keep up with that last super reaction even in slowmo. Speaking of, I think he dodged the pile bunker twice after seeing the move. If so he has crazy kinetic eyesight #TABOO_NEWS
The craziest part is the operating system for TanegashiMachine 3 Custom. It looked exactly like KB #TABOO_NEWS
The operator's skill level of the Robotics Club was amazing. If we're just talking about that, I think theirs is better than Mr. Pleiades #TABOO_NEWS
Is that operating system from KB? #TABOO_NEWS
I heard the programmer for KB has been missing for 2 days #TABOO_NEWS
Direct interview with the main programmer of Kill-Ballad, Koujiro Frau, in Tanegashima! The face of the genius high school programmer! #GGGGAME_COM #http://ggg.c/0702xx_
What? It's Koujiro Frau and not Frau Koujiro? And she a girl?! GGGGAME_COM
And she's a fujoshi lol GGGGAME_COM
Kinda disappointed. I thought it was like some crazy old man. Oh well GGGGAME_COM
She's cute. Let's praise her as Frau-sama from now on GGGGAME_COM
She kinda looks like a shut-in. Bad personality. Has eyes like a dead fish GGGGAME_COM
High school girl lol I'm sure she doesn't even go to school. She's just a NEET GGGGAME_COM
I think it's amazing that she created a game of that scale at her age GGGGAME_COM
Is Frau Koujiro from Tanegashima? GGGGAME_COM
Looks like she moved there. That's what the article said GGGGAME_COM
How did the media find out about a doujin-loving programmer moving to a far away island? Is it worth camping out for her at the airport? GGGGAME_COM
I never liked her from how she acted, but finding out she's an actual girl the story is different now. Her likability went way up GGGGAME_COM
“I'm rotten to the core. Too fast duhuhu.” What the hell is she saying lolol GGGGAME_COM
Over 20,000,000 people are just dancing like they're pawns of this chick... Maybe I'll quit KB GGGGAME_COM
I'm much more interested in KB after reading this article. Is it still fun to start now? GGGGAME_COM
PokeCom experiences 46 seconds of radio storm. Over 50,000,000 units affected #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0703xx_
Seems like the freeze was all over Japan. It was confirmed in Okinawa and Hokkaido too. But even while that was going on, our neighbors in Russia and Korea weren't affected at all #TABOO_NEWS
I think it's the connection that Japan uses, not the PokeCom's fault #TABOO_NEWS
I think it's linked to the solar storm #TABOO_NEWS
I didn't know there was a big solar storm yesterday #TABOO_NEWS
They announced that they're still looking into the problem, so we can't say anything until we hear the results #TABOO_NEWS
Ridiculous! Because of that freeze my business negotiation worth 200,000,000 fell through! I'm gonna sue them! #TABOO_NEWS
@ZELLAR981 If it fell through in 46 seconds, it wasn't going to make it in the first place lol #TABOO_NEWS
I'm glad it was just the PokeCom freezing. If every electronic device froze, people would've died #TABOO_NEWS
@14URU There are some who were injured #TABOO_NEWS
Someone got in an accident following their PokeCom's navigation, right? I think that's kinda whack. Like how much are you relying on GPS? #TABOO_NEWS
I was playing KB and was about to beat the 14th ranker, but that interference thing happened and now it doesn't count! What are you gonna do about this?! #TABOO_NEWS
I wonder why the PokeCom itself froze even though it was an electronic storm. Was it set to act like that? #TABOO_NEWS
I wouldn't care too much if it was one and done. But this can happen again in the future right? I hope they find the problem and deal with it fast #TABOO_NEWS
I can't think of my life without a PokeCom, can't go back to a smartphone now #TABOO_NEWS
It's kinda useless to me as someone who doesn't have a PokeCom #TABOO_NEWS
Blog update -> When will the next crash of '15 come? The countdown has already begun #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/0704xx_
Kurokane-shi is writing articles that will make people freak out again... #KUROKANE
I read that a major solar storm will occur this year in some conspiracy theory. So maybe he isn't completely wrong? #KUROKANE
@MIKITY10008 Some conspiracy theory? What's the source? Don't fuel it with your assumptions. You're doing the same thing as Kurokane-shi. Shame on you. #KUROKANE
What, another solar storm is coming? All the PCs in the company died from the one 4 years ago. It's seriously gonna hurt this time #KUROKANE
Tokyo was dead silent for about 2 days cuz of the crash of '15. A lot of electronics were broken too #KUROKANE
It's been 4 years, but they still haven't fully recovered yet. There are a lot of things half-fixed like train ticket machines at a station only a few people go to, escalators visible from the outside, and many other things #KUROKANE
There were so many people that couldn't go home. The trains were completely stopped and the busses weren't moving since there were no traffic lights. At the time I felt like we learned nothing from our mistakes #KUROKANE
The lessons learned from the crash of '15 are being utilized. I mean, aren't the solar storm protection measures already in place? #KUROKANE
It's only been 4 years. I can't fully believe that the measures are completely in place when we haven't fully recovered from it #KUROKANE
Stocks are gonna crash again huh? #KUROKANE
There are many people talking like this is going to be the same size as the crash of '15, but do they not understand that a bigger one can hit? #KUROKANE
The time finally has come to leave Japan #KUROKANE
@NORICK_250 Where are you gonna go lol Other countries will be affected by the solar storm too #KUROKANE
ROBO-ONE World tournament announced! Set in beautiful Las Vegas this August! #ZANSPO #http://zs.o/0705xx_
 ROBO-ONE World Championships coming next month! #ZANSPO
Wow wow that was sudden! RO41 just ended the other day! #ZANSPO
Who's entering the world tournament from Japan?! I heard that Mr. Pleiades is entering but who else? #ZANSPO
What, Mr. Pleiades is confirmed for the world tournament?! YASSSSS! Throw them out with the devil's hand! #ZANSPO
Who do you want to see enter? Personally, I'd love Lovely Fairy and NinNin Rikishi! #ZANSPO
Mr. Pleiades's world stage debut! He'll definitely be a smash hit overseas lol #ZANSPO
@GEMONIUM A smash overseas... drools #ZANSPO
@KOMURASA_KI Hey stop having delusions #ZANSPO
I've seen robot battle tournaments held in America before. They're more dangerous because the winner is decided based on who destroys the opponent's robots first. If things don't go well they might get crushed #ZANSPO
There are so many crazy hobby robots in America lol They're more like RC destruction machines. Some have chainsaws and hammers on them. Maybe ROBO-ONE is like a joke to them #ZANSPO
I mean it's ROBO-ONE World so it'll be the same ROBO-ONE rules right? Robots from Japan shouldn't be destroyed...
I'd like to see robots from outside America and Japan too #ZANSPO
What about the Robotics Club from Tanegashima that got second place?! Will they enter? I hope they match up with Mr. Pleiades at the World Championships. I'd be soooo happy #ZANSPO
Robotics Club huh... I hope they enter. They did lose the last tournament, but the crowd was on their side #ZANSPO
Internet broadcast since it's in America? NicoVid is gonna be lit up! #ZANSPO
A mysterious phenomenon, St. Elmo's fire, is being seen all over the world #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/0707xx_
St. Elmo's fire is the thing when the plane lights up when riding it right? I've experienced it before, but it was scary #ZACOZACO
Not just planes, tall skyscrapers in the city have been lighting up too #ZACOZACO
I mean auroras are coming out so the electromagnetic waves must be going crazy. It's probably from that, nothing special #ZACOZACO
Saint Elmo's fire is the atmospheric electromagnetic phenomenon right? #ZACOZACO
The news has been saying that the amount of electromagnetic waves has been abnormal recently. Our bodies will get messed up if you get hit by that many electromagnetic waves #ZACOZACO
@BLACKYYFDAHLIA I think you're getting electromagnetic waves and radiation mixed up? #ZACOZACO
Electromagnetic waves are a type of silent weapon. Without making any noise or causing physical destruction, it attacks the human body and causes major harm from the inside out. The US army used that for the war in Iraq, it's a legit lethal weapon #ZACOZACO
Search “Long range acoustic device (LRAD)” and “active denial system (ADS)” then you'll be really confused by what justice is #ZACOZACO
@JOHN_SMITH33 You think an aurora was created with a silent weapon? #ZACOZACO
@JOHN_SMITH33 Nice delusions bro #ZACOZACO
@JOHN_SMITH33 We should really think about it because this silent weapon is working, the auroras are showing up #ZACOZACO
NASA just announced it's because the sun is going into its peak activity period #ZACOZACO
Fatal accident from a HUG malfunction. Are they hiding similar accidents that happened before? #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0711xx_
What what what?! Didn't know HUGs were so dangerous! #TABOO_NEWS
I mean if they sold 3,000,000 units 1 or 2 accidents are bound to happen. I think everyone is taking it too seriously #TABOO_NEWS
Do you know how many people die from car accidents? Don't bash HUGs for one fatal accident #TABOO_NEWS
We're taking it too seriously when someone died? Are you stupid? #TABOO_NEWS
After saying that it's completely safe and having a super high maintenance fee because you can only let HUG engineers touch it. And now this? #TABOO_NEWS
Maybe it was just a user mistake #TABOO_NEWS
Covering it up is what's bad. I don't think this is the only incident they're covering up. This is just the tip of the iceberg #TABOO_NEWS
I was really supportive of ExCo, but they've lost a lot of my trust #TABOO_NEWS
I still think they'll be the #1 popular company even with this under the belt #TABOO_NEWS
But where are Misaki-san's boobs #TABOO_NEWS
Right now, there's only one fatality that we know of right? #TABOO_NEWS
Pretty sure they're going to look into this some more soon. The media is all over it #TABOO_NEWS
If HUG Spark isn't getting canceled then it's all good #TABOO_NEWS
I have a physical disability and use the HUG, what should I do?! I'm hesitating to put it on because I'm so scared #TABOO_NEWS
I just walked passed a person with a HUG in the city and without thinking I prepared myself like I was gonna be attacked or something lol
I think the fact that they don't know the reason is bad. Exoskeleton needs to find that out and deal with it ASAP. Until then they should stop selling HUGs to new customers #TABOO_NEWS
But close to 3,000,000 people are using HUGs right? Having everyone stop using them is unrealistic. I wonder what ExCo is going to do #TABOO_NEWS
Blog update -> The dark relationship between ExCo and the media exposed from the HUG malfunction accident #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/0716xx_
Looks like Kurokane the free journalist is on normal operation lol #KUROKANE
Easy job to just scare people #KUROKANE
I think Kurokane-shi has the right argument about ExCo. The defense from the media is too awkward #KUROKANE
Isn't ExCo, a company that got so big really fast, a great target for the media? Considering the media has been a little quiet about them recently #KUROKANE
I don't get that feeling. Where did you get that from? They just can't move around as much because they don't have enough things to talk about #KUROKANE
HUG users should be more upset about this. That'll make the CEO come out officially #KUROKANE
What's up with the people defending ExCo? Are you saying to look the other way even though someone died from a HUG? How much did ExCo pay you? #KUROKANE
Is ExCo that much of an influential enterprise? I get that they have a lot of advertisements, but I don't think they're big enough to cover up comments with this much pressure #KUROKANE
Controlling freedom of speech or having a mole is so out of date. They don't exist #KUROKANE
Senomiya, was it? That PR girl is showing up on media, why don't you just ask her #KUROKANE
Speaking of, I haven't seen Misaki-san for 2-3 days now. Did she run away? #KUROKANE
Misaki-san? Maybe she's just staying away from the bad PR? #KUROKANE
The apocalyptic sounds heard all around the world are an omen of the world's end! #SPORTS_TOHO #http://st.n/0717xx_
There's a lot them posted on Mewtube and NicoVid so take a look. Crazy sounds are playing #SPORTS_TOHO
It has started! #SPORTS_TOHO
The cause of it hasn't been elucidated yet? #SPORTS_TOHO
I live in Saitama, but I heard that sound nearby too! I heard a loud sound ring from the other side of the mountain! Friends heard it too! #SPORTS_TOHO
Is this because of the sun's activity period? Or is it from the electromagnetic waves? #SPORTS_TOHO
I don't think you should blame the sun's activity period or electromagnetic waves for everything. You sound like a broken record #SPORTS_TOHO
It was heard before 2012 right? Then it has nothing to do with the solar storm #SPORTS_TOHO
It's Revelations. This is the sound of trumpets that state the end of the world. A solar storm will come soon and Earth will be destroyed #SPORTS_TOHO
I don't think it has to do with the solar storm, but when I see videos it really makes me think that we are in danger. The world really might come to an end #SPORTS_TOHO
It doesn't sound like an earthquake. What is it, really? #SPORTS_TOHO
It's a UFO! A UFO is here! #SPORTS_TOHO
No, it's the works of a tengu! #SPORTS_TOHO
If you try to rationalize it, it could just be the sound of wind going through a huge hole or tunnel getting amplified. #SPORTS_TOHO
Blog updated -> Crying only works when you are still a student, PR officials who don't understand that shouldn't be allowed #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/0720xx_
Don't bully Misaki-san! Kurokane should die! #KUROKANE
I will never forgive the people who made Misaki-san cry #KUROKANE
Crying Misakicchi was cute too. I got the chills #KUROKANE
You guys are screwed up in the mind lol #KUROKANE
Maybe they are mistaking that PR girl for an idol or something? There are responsibilities as a company to explain what's going on. Not knowing just cuz you're PR won't cut it #KUROKANE
That was basically bullying. It was a picture of media legally bullying a girl in her 20s. Talk about vulgar #KUROKANE
It's ExCo's CEO's fault. He should just hold a press interview and explain about the accident. Tbh, the CEO should just quit #KUROKANE
The media shouldn't target that girl and should go interview the big heads of ExCo instead. Everyone is really brainless #KUROKANE
If Misaki-san didn't force herself to answer those questions, she wouldn't have had to dig her own grave. No comment was the way to go #KUROKANE
Hey have you heard of the “HUG dance”? People that are wearing the malfunctioning HUG move awkwardly like a puppet. Looks like a dance #KUROKANE
@HAHIPUKUN Huh, wazzat? #KUROKANE
That HUG dance, if you actually see it I heard it's pretty rough. Joints bend to the wrong direction and carry out movements a human just can't do #KUROKANE
It's because the HUG forces movement that go against the will of the person wearing it. I don't want to be involved with it #KUROKANE
A dance? What a horrible joke #KUROKANE
A high school HUG user fell from the 3rd floor due to a HUG malfunction. Luckily he escaped death. Rumor is that the classmates who watched it happened posted that it was like a dance #KUROKANE
Mr. Pleiades sudden retirement announcement! #FUJISUN_TV #http://fs.t/0720xx_
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO #FUJISUN_TV
Pleiades-sama COME BAAACK!!!111 #FUJISUN_TV
It's a lie... Retirement is a lie... #FUJISUN_TV
Oh speaking of, Pleiades-kyun is sleeping next to me right now #FUJISUN_TV
I can't stop crying from the shock... #FUJISUN_TV
I am happy because I hated Pleiades #FUJISUN_TV
Pleiades-sama, you were my prince. Please be happy even after retirement #FUJISUN_TV
I will not accept it! I won't accept that I can't see Pleiades anymore! #FUJISUN_TV
Don't lie to me FujisunTVVVVVV!!! #FUJISUN_TV
Pleiades retiring?! Are you serious?! #FUJISUN_TV
I mean, he posted it himself #FUJISUN_TV
Pleiades, quitting as a winner. Not fair #FUJISUN_TV
Now this means that the next winner will be Tanegashima High! #FUJISUN_TV
What's gonna happen with the world tournament?! Who is going to enter?! Sato-maru?! TanegashiMachine 3?! #FUJISUN_TV
Maybe he was thinking to end with the world tournament? I mean he entered right? He should make it his last hurrah #FUJISUN_TV
At this point I want him to show his real face. He has to be handsome. Maybe I'll get drenched when I see his face! #FUJISUN_TV
A small sized solar storm hit the west-side of America. Malfunctions seen on some electronics #SOLARSTORM_NEWS #http://ssn.o/0730xx_
What is considered a small one? I can't tell at all #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Just like NASA said. It will come in 2019, they announced it like 6 years ago #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
This is the beginning. Just the beginning... #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
There are no abnormalities in Japan right? Then it must mean it was a small size. There is no point getting worked up about it #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Something like the crash of '15 won't happen again... Right? #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
There is no point being worried about America. Are you stupid? #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
It's more like “thank you America for taking the hit.” It would be great if this means no more solar storms. #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
I don't think there is a solar storm-kun that pinpoint targets a small island country like Japan. How far do you think Earth is from the sun? #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
I mean the countermeasures for the solar storm have been made, right? Then everything should be fine #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Electronics are affected even though it was a small solar storm? Are they dumb? #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
I was planning to go to Vegas next week. Will it be calmed down by then? #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Solar storms only come for an instant. They don't stay forever. So by tomorrow it should be fine #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Seems like Kurokane-shi is going to write another article to worry people lol #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Kagome Kagome Incident is Happening Nationally. Maker: “That ringtone exists” #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/0731xx_
Is it true? The ringtone already exists? I didn't find it on my PokeCom #ZACOZACO
@DIY_ASH Maybe it depends on the model? I think it only rang for people who have the ringtone #ZACOZACO
My PokeCom doesn't have it but it rang! #ZACOZACO
What's with these dumb kids who don't read the source. It doesn't look like it, but it's stored in all PokeComs as data #ZACOZACO
A ringtone that I can't pick rang #ZACOZACO
So to make it simple, we don't know the reason why it all rang together across the nation #ZACOZACO
Was anybody brave enough to pick up? #ZACOZACO
@ANGELCROW Of course there was. Internet is full of reports of people picking up #ZACOZACO
When you pick up, you hear a high-pitched noise. Then after a little it hangs up #ZACOZACO
I picked up the Kagome Kagome call. I think only older people will understand, but it sounded like when you send a fax. It was very close to that #ZACOZACO
I feel awkward about this because it feels like someone just used your PokeCom without permission #ZACOZACO
It wasn't heard anywhere besides Japan right? #ZACOZACO
There was an incident that was kinda like this overseas. For example, there was an incident that Symphony No. 9 played all across Spain last month #ZACOZACO
There are multiple incidents from back then. Like the rumor that ‘You may pass’ played when the Shibuya earthquake hit #ZACOZACO
@YGH_24 I was in Shibuya at the time, and certainly ‘You may pass’ played! #ZACOZACO
This is all because of the red aurora lol #ZACOZACO
Typhoon #6 Will Reach Kyushu Area by Tomorrow Morning #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0731xx_
Typhoon #6 looks intense #TABOO_NEWS
Hitting Kyushu? But looking at the route, doesn't seem like it'll hit the Kanto area #TABOO_NEWS
It goes through Kyushu, then it goes through the Sea of Japan. I couldn't care less #TABOO_NEWS
HUG Malfunction Accident: A HUG-Wearing Mother Kicks Baby to Death #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0801xx_
This is horrible #TABOO_NEWS
It's happening all over the world and not just in Japan! They should be ashamed. ExCo needs to go out of business! #TABOO_NEWS
Kicking your own baby to death because you wore a HUG suit for the lower half of your body is horrible. The mother had her full mental capabilities but couldn't stop it #TABOO_NEWS
My tears won't stop... As a person who has a child, I can't stand these tragedies #TABOO_NEWS
Hey the mother was just plain stupid. You can take HUG off easily. She could've just taken it off if she thought something was up #TABOO_NEWS
Wow, what a tragedy... #TABOO_NEWS
If you are panicking, it doesn't matter how easy it is to take off, you won't be able to by yourself #TABOO_NEWS
People bashing on the mother are crazy. Go to a hospital #TABOO_NEWS
I feel like if a HUG kicked at full power, even an adult would die instantly, let alone a baby... #TABOO_NEWS
It depends if it was a soccer kick or if it was like stomping #TABOO_NEWS
First of all, isn't this incident from over 3 years ago? Why is media bringing this accident up again? Sounds like they just want to blame ExCo #TABOO_NEWS
It just means that these kinds of accidents were getting covered up #TABOO_NEWS
The real hell starts now. All the past accidents are going to be revealed #TABOO_NEWS
Hug Malfunction Accident, a Man in His 70s Dies From His Body Getting Twisted #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0803xx_
This again! #TABOO_NEWS
ExCo is done for #TABOO_NEWS
HUGs aren't gonna sell anymore #TABOO_NEWS
Body getting twisted... It's terrifying to think that could happen to me #TABOO_NEWS
Did he get wrung like an old rag... #TABOO_NEWS
No! Don't say that... #TABOO_NEWS
The HUG dance must have been rough too #TABOO_NEWS
It would've been a little better if it wasn't in front of their family #TABOO_NEWS
I wonder how the granddaughter felt seeing her grandpa die from the HUG dance #TABOO_NEWS
How dark is ExCo to hide such a horrible accident?! #TABOO_NEWS
If you sue, you could get 10 billion per person #TABOO_NEWS
The CEO is still hiding and hasn't done a press interview? I question his morals #TABOO_NEWS
Again, this accident is from over 5 years ago! This has already been taken care of! #TABOO_NEWS
Taken care of? How? Your source? #TABOO_NEWS
Riots in North America: A New One in San Francisco. No Signs of Calming Down as Their Number Continue to Grow #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0805xx_
What? This is still going on? Who was the one who said it'll calm down soon #TABOO_NEWS
@RUSH0809 What will calm down will be the electronics malfunctioning due to the solar storm. I don't know about the riots that happened because of it #TABOO_NEWS
It is growing. And you can't stop it anymore #TABOO_NEWS
The riots and solar storm have nothing to do with each other #TABOO_NEWS
But it is a fact that the confusion from the solar storm caused the riots #TABOO_NEWS
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is saying we should stop travelling to the west coast of America #TABOO_NEWS
Really? It's that bad? It doesn't seem that serious to me. #TABOO_NEWS
Maybe people died and we don't know about it #TABOO_NEWS
Why is there a riot? A solar storm isn't reason enough for a riot to start #TABOO_NEWS
The solar storm was just an opportunity. That country already had something wrong going on #TABOO_NEWS
This might be worse than the LA riot #TABOO_NEWS
Fatal HUG Accident Where a HUG Became Uncontrollable and Forced Its User to Run Into the Road While Waiting for a Traffic Light #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0807xx_
Recently there has been a lot of HUG accidents. Maybe HUG products are defective? #TABOO_NEWS
Obviously a defective product! Recall them! What is that scumbag company doing staying quiet! #TABOO_NEWS
Can't even peacefully wait for the signal to change #TABOO_NEWS
It makes me sad that we haven't seen Misaki-san #TABOO_NEWS
That means all these accidents were covered up right? How much is ExCo paying the police and media #TABOO_NEWS
HUG-tan is so playful that it jumps into the street right when a car drives by #TABOO_NEWS
Looks like the research committee came out, guess they'll start taking this seriously now. Makes me laugh #TABOO_NEWS
They should get to the bottom of this, but Misaki-san has nothing to do with it #TABOO_NEWS
Misaki followers are supporting ExCo because they are her fans. Totally brain dead #TABOO_NEWS
The CEO of ExCo should just get over it and make Misaki-san cry and apologize. Then I'll forgive them #TABOO_NEWS
 ROBO-ONE World Championships Canceled Due to US Riots #ZANSPO #http://zs.o/0810xx_
What, canceled?! Seriously, are you serious?! #ZANSPO
Seri—ous—ly—?! #ZANSPO
WHAAAAAAAT?! #ZANSPO
I bought tickets and took days off!!! #ZANSPO
Wow... canceled... I was really looking forward for it #ZANSPO
I feel a little better since if it was held I wouldn't be able to go due to the riots #ZANSPO
If they'd kept it, it could've been a target for the riots #ZANSPO
Pleiades retiring was foreshadowing this... #ZANSPO
Dammittt... Dammiiitttt!!! #ZANSPO
RO42 will be held as usual at the end of the year so to us living in Japan this is not big news #ZANSPO
Well, it's a good decision #ZANSPO
Chuo Tanegashima High Robotics Club giant robot didn't move #NANNICHI_WEB #http://nnw.n/0811xx_
Wow, this robot is ugly #NANNICHI_WEB
Sorry, it made me laugh a little #NANNICHI_WEB
Japan is peaceful #NANNICHI_WEB
Blog update -> The CEO of RI, Tojyo-shi, roars at ExCo! #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/0813xx_
Kurokane is annoying, but what Tojyo is saying is right. If this keeps up, the robot boom will end. It doesn't take much to end a boom #KUROKANE
CEO of RI is way too pissed lol #KUROKANE
To RI Company, this is a life or death situation. If the robot industry's image goes down it's not a going to be good #KUROKANE
Kurokane is totally in ExCo bashing mode #KUROKANE
What Tojyo-san said is correct. If this keeps going on, next year's expo might be canceled too #KUROKANE
@SAGINOSUKE_YO It won't. There is only like half a year left. How much money do you think the city and country put into the expo? No way are they going to cancel #KUROKANE
Yes, next year's Tokyo Expo is called Robot Expo but that doesn't mean only robots are displayed. In Shinagawa and Toyosu they have regular stages #KUROKANE
The city of Tokyo is full of robots. If the distrust of robots increase, locals will start feeling uneasy. It could be like the US rioting if this keeps going on #KUROKANE
I know Kurokane pointed it out, but Japanese people are calm so riots won't happen. Plus Tokyo is full of people who don't care #KUROKANE
Don't worry, robots will not attack humans. There is something called the three laws of robotics #KUROKANE
@SOKKO_P The three laws of robotics mean nothing if they are uncontrollable #KUROKANE
Selling robots that go out of control is wrong. ExCo should seriously show some remorse #KUROKANE
There is the solar storm thing too. I think it's ok to use tax money for serious cases like this #KUROKANE
Five Service Robots Destroyed In Shinjuku, Tokyo #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0818xx_
Destroying 5 in a row is kind of like a blow out lol #TABOO_NEWS
I understand that feeling. They get in the way. And plus they talk to you even though you didn't ask anything #TABOO_NEWS
I was irritated from work so I kicked them! #TABOO_NEWS
If you do it too much I heard you get reported, even though they are machines #TABOO_NEWS
You don't need robots. Who is going to stop them when they go out of control #TABOO_NEWS
This is also Exoskeleton Company's fault #TABOO_NEWS
Up until now, we were all doing fine despite our complaints. But because ExCo poorly handled this whole situation, the frustration was taken out on service robots that have nothing to do with this
I mean, there are many men who lost their jobs to those machines. Of course it's going to be a battle #TABOO_NEWS
Speaking of, RI is making service robots right. What Kurokane said in the interview became reality. I think they should sue ExCo. Seriously #TABOO_NEWS
Robot removal movement in the Middle East. Debates on regulation bill in the EU #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/0819xx_
Maybe Japan was the only one that was happy about the robot boom? #ZACOZACO
Japanese people especially like robots, but it's not like that overseas. It's more common to reject them #ZACOZACO
@KUREKURESAGI So you are just going to ignore that oversea makers are making giant robots too #ZACOZACO
I think that the Middle East has more resistance against robots especially #ZACOZACO
At the end of the day, it's just preconception. They don't really understand anything about robots #ZACOZACO
@DOJIKKO You say that, but how much do you actually understand Middle Eastern culture? People just make assumptions #ZACOZACO
Must be a horrible sight. They are calling robots and HUG the work of the devil #ZACOZACO
This is all because of ExCo #ZACOZACO
HUG was getting accepted by outside countries because it wasn't a robot. I guess that's coming to an end? #ZACOZACO
But ExCo still hasn't officially apologized yet. Normally, they'd already be getting destroyed by the media #ZACOZACO
Speaking of, yesterday Sugishita-san, the Minister of Infrastructure, was supporting ExCo. I wonder if he was paid off-the-books? #ZACOZACO
Multiple sightings of a fireball?! What is the truth behind the scary phenomenon happening?! #SPORTS_TOHO #http://st.n/0822xx_
My friend saw the fireball too #SPORTS_TOHO
Why is it a fireball? Fireballs are in the old scary stories #SPORTS_TOHO
Looks like there is a lot of sighting reports. When you search it on Twipo, you hit a lot #SPORTS_TOHO
Wha, it's really a fireball? #SPORTS_TOHO
Is it a fireball or a human soul. I want them to clear that up #SPORTS_TOHO
It's probably plasma #SPORTS_TOHO
@TIKUWA_ANA Plasma lol #SPORTS_TOHO
It's plasma. To be exact, it's from the electromagnetic wave causing the red aurora #SPORTS_TOHO
@ME_A_CAT Yup. It connects to the solar storm #SPORTS_TOHO
So all the old stories about lights, I mean urban legend-ish things, were all electromagnetic waves from the sun? Like UFOs and St. Elmo's Fire #SPORTS_TOHO
Facility public viewing at the Tanegashima Space Center, popular with tourists #NANNICHI_WEB #http://nnw.n/0825xx_
Went to Tanegashima yesterday. It was an empty island. But the fact that it was empty was refreshing. Made me want to relax a bit #NANNICHI_WEB
I always looked forward to when they open to the public. There used to be a lot more visitors 5 years ago, but it has been decreasing. Which is fine because I can enjoy it more with less people here #NANNICHI_WEB
There were only older men and families. Maybe young boys are only interested in robots so they don't show up #NANNICHI_WEB
Tanegashima is far. It would be a commitment to go that far #NANNICHI_WEB
I felt the energy from the workers there. I hope they start launching rockets again. Then more people will come visit? #NANNICHI_WEB
What is this?! The last episode of Gunvarrel leaked?! #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/0826xx_
WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! #ANIME_MATOME
IT'S HEEERREEE!!! #ANIME_MATOME
Episode 156!!! #ANIME_MATOME
Is the last episode the one that got canceled?! It actually exists?! #ANIME_MATOME
Why now #ANIME_MATOME
I watched but I don't get it #ANIME_MATOME
Is it real?! Is it really real?! #ANIME_MATOME
It just looks like unfinished scenes put together. There isn't any sound either #ANIME_MATOME
I'm glad I stayed a Gunvarrel fan! I didn't think I would be able to see the last episode after cancelling 4 years ago! It's unfinished but it's enough! #ANIME_MATOME
The last ep is here?! #ANIME_MATOME
Director Kogoori is back?! #ANIME_MATOME
I saw it, but it doesn't look fun at all. There isn't the excitement of Gunvarrel #ANIME_MATOME
Is this girl Rosetta praying? Why does she look so sad. It's the last episode #ANIME_MATOME
New one? #ANIME_MATOME
A Rosetta like that has never been seen once in the TV series. It is definitely the last episode #ANIME_MATOME
Hey... Does everyone... die in the end? #ANIME_MATOME
Oh, another fanfic? #ANIME_MATOME
Keep it quiet in a first time just to attract attention when you then upload it, and when it becomes popular be like: “I actually made it. Was everyone surprised? I'll be selling it at ComiMa so please buy it!” is probably the plan. It's just a publicity stunt #ANIME_MATOME
@992KUGUTU If it's self-advertisement then that person made enemies with all the Gunvarrel fans in the world #ANIME_MATOME
It doesn't feel like a happy ending. Was this really Gunvarrel's finale? #ANIME_MATOME
Crazy how you guys know it looks boring from just a 4min patchworked vid #ANIME_MATOME
The oversea fans are grieving over it #ANIME_MATOME
Maybe they canceled the last episode since it was poorly written? #ANIME_MATOME
If this isn't a doujin I will do a handstand and drink through my nose #ANIME_MATOME
Isn't this leaked video kinda weird? #ANIME_MATOME
Who uploaded it? #ANIME_MATOME
Reviewing the dreamlike last episode of Gunvarrel. Earth's destroyed in an annihilation ending?! #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/0827xx_
Hey, let's examine the ending from the 4min 31 sec video #ANIME_MATOME
I can only picture an “Annihilation End” #ANIME_MATOME
It looks like Rosetta backstabbed too #ANIME_MATOME
Rosetta had no choice but to destroy the world. Look, she is even crying #ANIME_MATOME
Didn't expect Rosetta to use the Grand Obelisk instead of aNubis. I can't close my mouth from shock #ANIME_MATOME
From the flow of the story there weren't any signs that Rosetta would have to make that decision #ANIME_MATOME
I wonder what happened to the others? Genki was the only one in that leaked footage. Where are the others? #ANIME_MATOME
They probably died #ANIME_MATOME
Rosetta the slaughterer lolol #ANIME_MATOME
Destroyed her enemies, including people on her side. Also took multi-billion people with them. Screw that #ANIME_MATOME
Gunvarrel would never end like that! It looks like an annihilation, but everyone is alive! #ANIME_MATOME
Or it was just aNubis's delusion #ANIME_MATOME
Nonetheless, it doesn't look like Gunvarrel does much. It's totally a story about Rosetta #ANIME_MATOME
WHAAAA you killed Erlih-sama?! Can'tforgiveRosettacan'tforgiveRosettacan'tforgiveRosettacan'tforgiveRosetta!!!1!!!1 #ANIME_MATOME
Finally overcoming her title as least noticed character at the very end. But in a horrible way #ANIME_MATOME
Disgusted. The leaked video was not complete, but I got it from just that. All the parties involved need to apologize #ANIME_MATOME
The main staff hasn't been involved in a single other production since Gunvarrel. I wonder why #ANIME_MATOME
The Grand Obelisk shoots the sun and then the power of the sun goes berserk and destroys Earth. Isn't it kinda close to our situation? It feels like they are talking about the solar storm #ANIME_MATOME
I get it! The last episode didn't get aired because it was so bad! #ANIME_MATOME
I wish it didn't get leaked if it was this. Feels like I'm going to hate Gunvarrel >< #ANIME_MATOME
Looks like there is a mysterious subliminal message in the last episode of Gunvarrel #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/0828xx_
Hey, I just watched the last episode slowed down, and for a second there is a weird video mixed in. I'll upload the capture so take a look. It's at 0:41 #ANIME_MATOME
@AROHA_ISHI It's really there... #ANIME_MATOME
@AROHA_ISHI What is this #ANIME_MATOME
@AROHA_ISHI Isn't this a subliminal messsage or something #ANIME_MATOME
It's subliminal. It's banned in Japan. Is this ok? #ANIME_MATOME
@5MINE Not just Japan, its banned all over the world #ANIME_MATOME
There is another at 1:03 #ANIME_MATOME
Found one at 2:39 #ANIME_MATOME
I thought it was flashy, but I heard it was subliminal messages? That's what it was. There's probably more of it #ANIME_MATOME
What is this? It's just a mashup of an unfinished anime video, but how are there also subliminal messages? #ANIME_MATOME
I pulled out some of the subliminal messages from the video, but most of it was incomprehensible. Confirmed 107 of Shibuya. Also Fukuzawa Yukichi #ANIME_MATOME
What matters is if the video always had subliminal messages from the start or if someone added it in before uploading #ANIME_MATOME
How many subliminal messages are there? Looks like there is a lot #ANIME_MATOME
There's more than 10 places just from looking at it #ANIME_MATOME
@PANCHO_LION 16 places #ANIME_MATOME
@HAYONM Isn't it 17? #ANIME_MATOME
It's hard to make anything out with all the noise. It doesn't look like anime. I think they're from a film? #ANIME_MATOME
@MIZ_KORI Or it's an effect to make it look like it's made from a film #ANIME_MATOME
Maybe they used subliminal messages in episodes 1 through 155... #ANIME_MATOME
They gained fame from brainwashing. Gunvarrel's popularity is fake #ANIME_MATOME
Think about it: Gunvarrel's popularity was unreal. Yeah, it's a very fun anime, but to be label it a godlike anime at a world level... #ANIME_MATOME
Compared to anime in the 20th century, due to hobbies growing popular too, it was hard for a mega-hit anime to come out after the year 2000. Of those Gunvarrel was the only one that stood out #ANIME_MATOME
@PIRO_PIKIMOTO That's because they had the world on their side #ANIME_MATOME
@PIRO_PIKIMOTO I mean that was the goal. Even though it was sneaky, that is why it was aired overseas first and not in Japan #ANIME_MATOME
What is the meaning of the subliminal messages in the last episode of Gunvarrel? #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/0831xx_
Can't even figure it out after 4 days. Looks like we are the losers. The power of the internet has grown weak #ANIME_MATOME
I feel kinda sick #ANIME_MATOME
Is this really the last episode of Gunvarrel? Is this real? #ANIME_MATOME
@ABYSSOFJO Only the staff involved in Gunvarrel can answer that question #ANIME_MATOME
Where is the director and main staff? And what are they doing? #ANIME_MATOME
I watch a lot of anime including Gunvarrel, but after Gunvarrel got cut I don't think I saw the staff go anywhere else. No signs of them getting credit on another project #ANIME_MATOME
Maybe it's just a prank. When the video was going around, there was a rumor that it is a doujin #ANIME_MATOME
Everyone will be more happy if it ended as a prank #ANIME_MATOME
Looking at the video more and more, it just feels like a wasted effort. All I feel is nothingness #ANIME_MATOME
Nothing will remain. The glorious time when Gunvarrel was at the top, our amazing memories, all of that will be taken away and only a dead field will be left. This last episode should stay in the dark past #ANIME_MATOME
Summary of the leaked final episode of Gunvarrel #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/0914xx_
Episode 156!!! #ANIME_MATOME
Is the last episode the one that got canceled?! It actually exists?! #ANIME_MATOME
Hey... Does everyone... die in the end? #ANIME_MATOME
Disgusted. The leaked video was not complete, but I got it from just that. All the parties involved need to apologize #ANIME_MATOME
The main staff are not involved in other projects after Gunvarrel. Wonder why #ANIME_MATOME
The Grand Obelisk shoots the sun and then the power of the sun goes berserk and destroys Earth. Isn't it kinda close to our situation? It feels like they are talking about the solar storm #ANIME_MATOME

Looking at the video more and more, it just feels like a wasted effort. All I feel is nothingness #ANIME_MATOME
19 confirmed subliminal messages #ANIME_MATOME
Can't tell because the video is rough, but I'm pretty sure it's 19 #ANIME_MATOME
What the footage shows is super confusing. A Shibuya's 107, a space shuttle, black and white photo from WWII, the face of Fukuzawa Yukichi, all of them were something like that #ANIME_MATOME
It feels like there is a meaning, but you kinda have to force a meaning to be there #ANIME_MATOME
Isn't that what a conspiracy theory is? #ANIME_MATOME
We shouldn't flip the story to a conspiracy theory. The final episode was uploaded by someone and confusing subliminal messages were snuck in there. That itself should be treated as a case #ANIME_MATOME
Is there anyone that reported it? #ANIME_MATOME
@GOSSUGEPPO Because we are too chicken to #ANIME_MATOME
What do the subliminal messages mean? What is the meaning behind putting subliminal messages to an unfinished final episode of an anime? #ANIME_MATOME
Whoever put them in must have wanted to plant something in us through watching the video #ANIME_MATOME
An old man that is feeling nostalgic about the old times is telling us kids who don't know how good it used to be to study it #ANIME_MATOME
They are trying to lead you to be a cooperative slave. Basically saying get a job. Don't make me explain it, it's embarrassing #ANIME_MATOME
Subliminal messages are used to advertise the product subconsciously by slipping in an image of the product, right? All the inserted images were all useless #ANIME_MATOME
Maybe it means that Gunvarrel fans should love Yukichi-san #ANIME_MATOME
It's a mystery why there are 19 of them. It would be nice if there was a pattern, but it looks totally random #ANIME_MATOME
I wonder who first uploaded it. They're the one to ask about the subliminal messages #ANIME_MATOME
They leaked the final episode of Gunvarrel. That's for sure. Now the issue is when the subliminal messages got inserted #ANIME_MATOME
Were they inserted in 2015 when the final episode was being made, or were they inserted in 2019 right before it got uploaded online? #ANIME_MATOME
Tadpoles rain from the sky #SPORTS_TOHO #http://st.n/0920xx_
Hey, whoever said that tadpoles won't rain from the sky show yourself! I brought the source! #SPORTS_TOHO
@NEZUMI_ZAN The source is SpoEast lololol #SPORTS_TOHO
Oh, it only rained in Shibata-shi. How am I supposed to know about news from the country side #SPORTS_TOHO
@NEZUMI_ZAN So, where the pics at?#SPORTS_TOHO
I get that it was raining tadpoles, but why? #SPORTS_TOHO
@NTYFIO I dunno lolol #SPORTS_TOHO
This wouldn't happen in the norm. Can tadpoles actually be aliens? #SPORTS_TOHO
Before it was raining tadpoles, the tadpoles must have been thrown up in the air from a tornado or a storm nearby. There has to be #SPORTS_TOHO
It's not unusual or anything. This has been an issue couple times in the past. The birds throw them up. They're tossed up while they are flying so they fall fast. At times, over 50 tadpoles fall. It's a usual sight for the locals. Nothing special #SPORTS_TOHO
It was a crazy scene seeing over 5000 tadpoles fall! I thought the sky turned black then tadpoles started to fall and turned into hell in an instant #SPORTS_TOHO
What, 5000 of them?! First time hearing that. Too crazy #SPORTS_TOHO
Is this from the red aurora too? #SPORTS_TOHO
More subliminal messages discovered besides the 19 found so far in the final episode of Gunvarrel?! #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/1001xx_
I processed the subliminal footage so it's easier to view and I found something curious. Looks like there were more subliminal messages inserted in the 19 we found #ANIME_MATOME
@MAREAER Explain it easier #ANIME_MATOME
For example you know where Fukuzawa Yukichi was right? That was full of video distortion so I got rid of that, did some contrasting, then ran it frame by frame. When I did that it changed to a different images that wasn't Yukichi #ANIME_MATOME
@MAREAR English plz #ANIME_MATOME
There are subliminal messages in the subliminal messages! #ANIME_MATOME
@MAREAER That isn't your mistake? Like you forgot to turn off something. Or maybe it's a mistake made by whoever made the subliminal messages #ANIME_MATOME
Not just in Japan, but Gunvarrel fans all over the world were analyzing the final episode. How would they not notice the subliminal messages inside the subliminal messages for over a month? #ANIME_MATOME
Wait a sec. I just did some research too and there is something hidden! #ANIME_MATOME
Are you for real? So, there were more than 19 subliminal messages? #ANIME_MATOME
It really is an instant. With the distortion on you would miss it fosure. Whoever found it first is amazing #ANIME_MATOME
I watched it over and over but still don't see it #ANIME_MATOME
Did you know, even though this video is full of distortion it's actually 120 fps and not 60 fps? #ANIME_MATOME
@NANIOOO 120fps? Then one frame is 0.007 seconds. If it was inserted in that frame, there is a chance that you can miss it! #ANIME_MATOME
Hey, do you think it's safe to continue on? This is giving off a serious vibe #ANIME_MATOME
This was a challenge from the person who uploaded it #ANIME_MATOME
I feel some kind of unity #ANIME_MATOME
11.09 Solar Storm News. Currently, a solar proton phenomenon is happening. It is highly active, so please be careful #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
The solar storm news has been pretty active recently #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
It's probably another end of the world scam #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
I'm worried because of what happened in America. I don't want to be involved in a riot #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
@OHMORIP The riot in America wasn't directly connected to the solar storm. They were already in a nerve wrecking situation and to add to that a solar storm hit which blew it up. A riot won't happen in Japan just because a solar storm hit #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
Japan as a country has a lot of natural disasters like earthquakes and typhoons. So people are used to disasters. I'm sure that people will stay clam when the solar storm comes #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
I bet Japanese people will still try to go to work. Cause they are corporate slaves #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
We won't start a riot, even if we have complaints about the government and society. Being too quiet can be an issue, but we're proud of our sense of enduring crisis when a disaster hits #SOLARSTORM_NEWS
The mystery behind the hidden subliminal messages in the final episode of Gunvarrel #ANIME_MATOME #http://amc.n/1113xx_
Analyzing team, is it done yettt? #ANIME_MATOME
There are 19 total hidden 1 frame steganography subliminal messages, right? #ANIME_MATOME
@SURUPIN21 I am pretty sure since they took this much time and many people analyzed it #ANIME_MATOME
I think the steganography subliminal messages are an image of a ruin somewhere. But I doubt there is anyone that knows all the ruins in Japan #ANIME_MATOME
It's not sure that the steganography subliminal messages are located in Japan. There is a chance that it can be overseas #ANIME_MATOME
The power of the internet is amazing, but we still have a hard time solving this
It's too much to look for it in the world #ANIME_MATOME
Over it. Off 2 sleep #ANIME_MATOME
I wonder what the numbers mean #ANIME_MATOME
The numbers under the subliminal messages mean something. There has to be a meaning behind it #ANIME_MATOME
I want to try to analyze the numbers but don't know where to start #ANIME_MATOME
Maybe the numbers count down to the end of the world #ANIME_MATOME
It's the day when the solar storm is hitting! #ANIME_MATOME
Someone report it to the police. This is creepy! #ANIME_MATOME
@MK5043 The police ain't gonna deal with this! #ANIME_MATOME
A Major Solar Storm Hit the Kanto Area. The Capital Has Shut Down. Same Size as the Crash of '15 or Maybe Even Bigger #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/1119xx_
Twipo is laaagggiiinnnggg! Been loading forevvveeerrr! Makes me maaadddd!!! #TABOO_NEWS
My PokeCom is having problems and my apps just crash, is it broken?! How am I supposed to go home when there is a blackout?! I don't know the streets #TABOO_NEWS
The college girl next to me threw her PokeCom to the ground because it wouldn't turn on #TABOO_NEWS
Hey, when is the blackout gonna end?! #TABOO_NEWS
When are the trains gonna start back up?! #TABOO_NEWS
Lots of people who can't go home... #TABOO_NEWS
There are too many people at this pitch black station! It's too crowded, feels like I'm gonna fall off! #TABOO_NEWS
Im scared... It hurts... I want to leave the station but cant move... Help me... #TABOO_NEWS
We knew that the trains aren't moving. Why are people still coming to the station! #TABOO_NEWS
Accidents are happening left and right because there are no signal lights! This is a war zone! Are the people still driving in this situation just stupid or do they want to be murderers?! #TABOO_NEWS
This is not just in Tokyo. EU and China are having major issues too #TABOO_NEWS
 There are 200 planes flying over the Kanto area that we cannot contact. Danger of them crashing  #TABOO_NEWS
@CONSA_SHITING If a plane crashes in Shibuya or Shinjuku it's over! #TABOO_NEWS
There is a chance that 3000 satellites may be out of control! If this situation stays the same, within a couple hours they will enter the atmosphere! The scraps will spread all over the world! #TABOO_NEWS
A fire started at a building in Shinbashi #TABOO_NEWS
There is rumor that a tanker exploded on the bay bridge and they closed it. They said there is a chance that the leaked fuel might melt the bridge! #TABOO_NEWS
There is no fire at the bay bridge! Don't say random things! #TABOO_NEWS
The servers and PCs at work went down... Everything is over... This is a nightmare #TABOO_NEWS
Tokyo locals who don't have a back up are really stupid #TABOO_NEWS
@67SMILE There is a chance that the back ups are all screwed up too, idiot! The solar storm destroys all electronics, doesn't matter if it's online or a stand alone! #TABOO_NEWS
 The ATM at Mizuko bank in Ueno is broken and you can withdraw as much you want! So many people came! It's falling like dominoes! #TABOO_NEWS
Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, are all pitch black from the blackout! It's the end of the world! #TABOO_NEWS
 ISS has exploded! Repeat ISS has exploded! #TABOO_NEWS
 My husband works in the industrial area in Kawasaki. When I looked that way the sky was red. Is there a major fire there?! If anyone knows, please let me know! #TABOO_NEWS
Kyushu area is a-okay. Just that the PokeCom is a little laggy #TABOO_NEWS
Can't connect with my son in Tokyo #TABOO_NEWS
Exoskeleton Company HQ located in Aoyama is opening the first floor for people who can't get home. Please go there for help! #TABOO_NEWS
 The programmer for the world famous fighting game Kill-Ballad's announces terrorist attack! Someone stop her, please! If not Tokyo will be in more of a disaster! #KUROKANE
Kill-Ballad's programmer... You mean Koujiro Frau? #KUROKANE
What do you mean terrorist attack? #KUROKANE
Kurokane reacted to the terrorist attack announcement that Koujiro Frau made on Twipo! She took over the service robots from RI company by hacking them! #KUROKANE
Wowzers what is that girl thinking?! #KUROKANE
Is it even possible to take over them?! #KUROKANE
As Frau said, the servers of RI company are free to access!! A game just started and I got beat up though #KUROKANE
How could you aim a terrorist attack when Tokyo is in this much of a disaster! Talk about a low blow! #KUROKANE
Why would the programmer of KB need to start a terrorist attack? I can't think of the motive at all #KUROKANE
@YUI_AZUNYAN There is no motive. She is just crazy. Hurry up and report her! #KUROKANE
The police in Tokyo are not functioning. Because even if you call 911 it won't connect #KUROKANE
What Koujiro is saying is true! I was just in Roppongi right now and saw the RIICH series walking around in the blackout. They usually stops when you tell them but they didn't. It was really creepy #KUROKANE
More news about the terrorist attack by Koujiro Frau: the RIICH series are dangerous. Watch out for the white ones that stand by police stations! The police robots have been taken over! #KUROKANE
Find Koujiro right now! Where the hell is she?! #KUROKANE
@KIRARAKI She didn't expose her address #KUROKANE
It's Tanegashima! When you follow the logs of Koujiro Frau's account, it looks like she moved to Tanegashima #KUROKANE
Someone kill that chick! #KUROKANE
Do you understand how hard I'm working to get home?! I've walked for over 4 hours! And what are you doing?! Hacking robots and a terrorist attack?! You kidding me?! #KUROKANE
How did the RI get hacked that easily? Their security is soo damn weak! They should be responsible and get it back! #KUROKANE
Are the RI robots the only ones that Frau took over? Looks like the other service robots are moving for some reason... Could it be... #KUROKANE
Their foot steps are kinda creepy, ya know. Lots of pressure. That's all of my mind because the city's so quiet during the blackout #KUROKANE
I think there are too many robots. Were there really this many robots in Tokyo? #KUROKANE
Are they trying to attack the Diet? Isn't that really bad? #KUROKANE
A country that flips out due to robots. It's not even a joke #KUROKANE
Someone stop that terrorist girl! What are the police and JSDF doing?! #KUROKANE
Rather than that is there anyone who can get pass along the key to RI Company! It's just a game! #KUROKANE
 I received some shocking news. The woman who is currently causing the terrorist attack, Koujiro Frau, is the daughter of Kogoori Minami, the director of the anime Gunvarrel #KUROKANE
THREAD. And that Kogoori Minami, aka Furugoori Minami, killed 13 staff members of Gunvarrel! She's a mass murderer who is still on the run! If this is true, it would be Japan's worst crime case! #KUROKANE
THREAD. Currently under investigation, but sources say that all 13 people died mysteriously just days before the release of the final episode. And since then Furugoori Minami has gone missing and seen by no one #KUROKANE
END OF THREAD. Therefore, the person who is running this terrorist attack, Koujiro Frau, is the daughter of a murderer and has the blood of a serial killer! #KUROKANE
Kurokane's article is pretty bad. Talk about assumptions. It's at a level that he might be sued for defamation #KUROKANE
Kurokane-san only comes out with a sound argument #KUROKANE
The story that 13 people died is true. I was in the police department at the time so I know. That case was covered by the higher ups #KUROKANE
A conspiracy theory?! There is no way that an anime director has the power to shut the police up! #KUROKANE
At the time, I was working at at different anime company but those 13 people all of a sudden disappeared. There were rumors that they fled by night, but I didn't think that had happened... #KUROKANE
I can't see Furugoori Minami killing 13 people. I mean she is a woman #KUROKANE
Wasn't there like a message from Kogoori Minami the analyst found in the leaked final episode? From that, it rather looked like Kogoori Minami was getting chased by someone #KUROKANE
Director Kogoori was saying that Gunvarrel is a brainwashing device and a propaganda. She wrote that everyone died and she ran away to prevent the terrorist attack. I can't think that the director killed them #KUROKANE
Is what Kurokane-shi saying the truth? #KUROKANE
Now there is a chance that Kogoori Minami's message is fake. I mean her daughter Koujiro Frau is running a terrorist attack as we speak #KUROKANE
Kill Kogoori Minami and Koujiro Frau! By killing the terrorist family this blackout will be fixed too! #KUROKANE
@GUARDIAN_STYLE I get that you can't forgive the Furugoori family, but do not put out a killing notice. You are going to get arrested #KUROKANE
If the family was this dangerous, I'm sure that Public Safety would've marked them #KUROKANE
I think the police and public safety are confused and can't make a move. In other words, maybe Koujiro Frau was aiming for this timing #KUROKANE
Who is the one in the back pulling the strings, Furugoori Minami? Or the guys Mimami Furugoori is talking about? #KUROKANE
It just a typical conspiracy theory structure. They are both made up! They both don't even exist! #KUROKANE
There shouldn't be a single person in Japan that is trying to subverse the state. That is ruined thought from over 50 years ago #KUROKANE
Maybe subverting the state isn't the goal. Maybe Furugoori Minami was killed by the state and her daughter is coming for revenge #KUROKANE
Isn't there anyone who can move in Tanegashima?! #KUROKANE
The Nightmare of the Crash of '15 Reappears. Six Days of Blackout. Long Way Until Everything Is Fully Back Up #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/1128xx_
My company is still rattled from not being able to get the tasks straight #TABOO_NEWS
We have to buy new PCs for the whole company so I contacted the maker but they told me it'll take half a year to get it to us. Give me a break #TABOO_NEWS
The makers should cover the repair fee for PCs and PokeComs in the first place. They knew that a solar storm was coming. Trying to take money in this situation is disrespectful to the customers #TABOO_NEWS
Stocks prices hit the floor and the 200000000 yen that I invested disappeared in those few days. Gonna go hang myself... #TABOO_NEWS
I live in the Kansai area but since the solar storm the PokeCom hasn't been working well #TABOO_NEWS
It wasn't fake news that the ISS went down... #TABOO_NEWS
The service robot at my work stopped working and it's kind of sad #TABOO_NEWS
It took years to get fully back up from the crash of '15, so it'll take some time this time too #TABOO_NEWS
This is what happens when you cheap out and not step up a full countermeasure for it. It's their fault, but us getting affected by it is annoying #TABOO_NEWS
I think there are less service robots in Tokyo now. So was the hacking of the robots to cause an terrorist attack fake news? #TABOO_NEWS
@TAIICCHHAANN The robot attack wasn't fake news. It really happened #TABOO_NEWS
Robot terrorist attack was prevented before it happened. Also, the suspected high school girl was completely innocent. Kurokane-shi is currently radio silent #TABOO_NEWS
What, Koujiro Frau wasn't the culprit behind the terrorist attack? #TABOO_NEWS
Why are you letting her off when there is no source that she is innocent. Plus there are rumors that her mother is a serial killer #TABOO_NEWS
@POKUORYUSHI There isn't proof that she is innocent, but there isn't proof that she isn't either #TABOO_NEWS
RI Company announced that they are going to collect all the RIICH series that are out. It was just on the news. That company is done for #TABOO_NEWS
A Japanese man was found dead in the Philippines with his face crushed #SPORTS_TOHO #http://st.n/1128xx_
The Governor Announces That Service Robot Safety Has Been Confirmed #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/1211xx_
The number of congressmen saying we should lower the amount of service robots has decreased. Seems like it's going to end with nothing changing #TABOO_NEWS
Even if a bill for service robots was brought up it would probably take over a year to get it cleared. By then the expo would've already passed so it wouldn't matter #TABOO_NEWS
They added more to prepare for next year's expo so it isn't realistic to get rid of them at this time #TABOO_NEWS
So they are going to leave over 10,000,000 people in danger while the expo is going on, pretty bad #TABOO_NEWS
I don't think there will be more solar storms coming. '15 and '19 were said to be the worst but we got past that. The sun should be calming down moving forward #TABOO_NEWS
I heard somewhere that you should be careful for solar storms in 2020... #TABOO_NEWS
The get-rid-of-service-robot-side must be people who lost their jobs to robots, anyway. It's unjustified resentment based on misunderstanding #TABOO_NEWS
I saw with my own eyes: robots marching toward Kasumigasaki when the blackout hit. Since then I'm afraid of robots. It scares me seeing them walking around in the city #TABOO_NEWS
I don't care about the locals fearing robots, but there will be more people visiting from overseas when the Expo is here. What're they gonna do when the robots attack people? It could turn into an international issue #TABOO_NEWS
Happiness4U announces major ‘IRUO.’ Maintenance on 12/24. Will be down on maintenance day #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/1213xx_
Maintenance on X-mas Eve?! #ZACOZACO
What is Happiness4U thinking? Are their workers, like, virgins? #ZACOZACO
WHAAATTT?! #ZACOZACO
What, rly? We can't use it? I wanted to enjoy being in Finland with my gf on X-mas Eve #ZACOZACO
Happiness4U read the room. Maybe they're just loopy from not being 100% back up after the solar storm #ZACOZACO
‘IRUO.’ won't be working but we can still use our PokeComs, right? Then it's fine #ZACOZACO
Good Job, Happiness4U! Amazing service! Hammer of justice to all the normies that are going to enjoy Christmas! #ZACOZACO
Blog update -> Senomiya Misaki is back on Twipo. How much did Exoskeleton gain from their mistakes #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/1214xx_
I understand you want to bash ExCo but you should blame the company or the CEO. Bashing Misaki-san does nothing #KUROKANE
Misaki is back?! I'm soo happy! #KUROKANE
WOOOO MISAKIIIII!!! #KUROKANE
I was so sad that you were silent! Glad that you are back and hope to see you in media #KUROKANE
Kurokane should think about how he treated Koujiro Frau rather than bashing someone #KUROKANE
Let's go, Misaki-san! I'm rooting for you! #KUROKANE
I hope she cries again. If Kurokane makes Misaki-san cry in an interview, I'll give him props #KUROKANE
Why does it sound like we forgave Senomiya Misaki? ExCo is in the middle of the case. Rather, why is that PR girl tweeping? I totally thought she was in major trouble #KUROKANE
It is part of her job to report that the HUG has countermeasures against solar storms. She is doing nothing wrong. She isn't playing around. Kurokane-san is reacting too much #KUROKANE
The annual cancel Christmas march will be at Shibuya again this year. Last year 500 people participated #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/1219xx_
Growing little by little, ey? Lololol #ZACOZACO
It's been going on for 10 years. Pretty amazing. They should put that energy toward finding a lover #ZACOZACO
Disgusting #ZACOZACO
Unattractive losers lolol Doing a march lolol Have your mommy buy you a Xmas cake lolol Well I have a get together in Roppongi tonight lolol #ZACOZACO
I am a woman, but planning to participate #ZACOZACO
What is the ratio at the march? If there are a lot girls, maybe I'll go too #ZACOZACO
We don't want people that are looking for someone to come. This is a sacred war to us. Don't corrupt this sacred fight #ZACOZACO
Happiness4U running a maintenance on Christmas Eve is god. They are on our side. Do more! #ZACOZACO
Japanese people should be shamed for joking that it's Sextmas Eve #ZACOZACO
Why do I have to be bashed for spending a beautiful night with my loved one #ZACOZACO
Hate only creates more hate. Let's be generous. Spend it with your loved ones and family. If you spend it together we can be all happy #ZACOZACO
Christmas should be canceled cause it's imprudent #ZACOZACO
They are imprudent-chus! #ZACOZACO
Cold sleep Experiment in Tanegashima?! A girl who was asleep for 10 years has been discovered #SPORTS_TOHO #http://st.n/1227xx_
The source is SpoEast lol #SPORTS_TOHO
Not like it's a SF movie #SPORTS_TOHO
Why Tanegashima? #SPORTS_TOHO
Sounds like a manga #SPORTS_TOHO
Yes, yes SpoEast SpoEast #SPORTS_TOHO
Who is gonna take this seriously? If it'd happened they'd be like a natural monument #SPORTS_TOHO
The ?! In the title explains it all. That's SpoEast quality, yup #SPORTS_TOHO
Moving steady to Expo opening. Geant2 by Runault from France is the first one to arrive #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/0119xx_
We get to see Geant2 in person?! This is exciting, hurry up and open the Expo #ZACOZACO
It's literally a super robot war. But with no fighting lolol #ZACOZACO
I mean more than 10 robots are gathering in Odaiba right? It's the first time in history #ZACOZACO
As the generation that watched mecha anime, I can't keep my cool #ZACOZACO
I want to see PrinceX by TAYOTA #ZACOZACO
Don't be all jolly. The capital is still not fully back up from the solar storm. We shouldn't be doing an Expo right now. If we had money it should be used for repairs #ZACOZACO
You are showing a pretty side by talking about Robot Expo and what not, but the number of homeless people in Tokyo is at its highest in history. How do you explain that Mr. Governor #ZACOZACO
There are more robots recently, right? Aqualiner is opening, but it's run by robots too, right? #ZACOZACO
The number of robots are increasing, but at the same time, more robots are getting destroyed too #ZACOZACO
When I hear things like that, I picture Tokyo's peace and order getting worse. How is it doing? #ZACOZACO
@SP_SIX I live in the city, but it hasn't changed much. I feel that if it'd been worse the city would be at its end. It still has a calm look to it. There are still a lot of people out at night #ZACOZACO
Is it really ok to open the Expo like this? #ZACOZACO
R2T Company of England asks JAXA to launch rocket. Launching at Tanegashima in March #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0121xx_
The request is confirmed. It's from R2T #TABOO_NEWS
What kind of company is it? Never heard of them #TABOO_NEWS
R2T is a company that works with satellites and navigation things if I'm not wrong. Just think of it as something like ‘IRUO.’ They used to be a state-owned enterprise but now are privately owned #TABOO_NEWS
Did R2T provide the rocket? If they are using the launch station in Tanegashima, it would be same size as the H-ⅡA. This is way too prepared to be a sudden announcement #TABOO_NEWS
There are rumors that Ocean Launch, a private rocket launching company, is running it #TABOO_NEWS
Ocean's launches are done on top of a huge ship or something? I thought they closed down like a year ago #TABOO_NEWS
They have been saved by the insolvency law. It was a topic brought up by Japanese companies invested in Ocean Launch and that TNSC can use the rockets too #TABOO_NEWS
Why are they launching at Tanegashima when Ocean Launch is involved? Isn't it cheaper to launch from the ocean? #TABOO_NEWS
Maybe they are not running the ship due to bankruptcy. And that's why they are launching in Tanegashima #TABOO_NEWS
Not from the bankruptcy, but the ship is affected by the solar storm #TABOO_NEWS
Originally, the R2T was supposed to launch in Guiana but it was postponed due to the solar storm. So maybe they had no choice but to ask Ocean Launch #TABOO_NEWS
HUG going out of control? 24 year old woman dies from falling in Tanegashima #NANNICHI_WEB #http://nnw.n/0128xx_
HUG again? Nothing is fixed even after half a year! #NANNICHI_WEB
Can ExCo be shut down already? #NANNICHI_WEB
Still working on the case won't cut it. While fighting for responsibility more people died. It's not even a joke #NANNICHI_WEB
They have to recall HUG like RIICH #NANNICHI_WEB
RI is showing sincerity, but ExCo is no good #NANNICHI_WEB
They are just being cocky. Showing their true face, I heard that they are working on military things too #NANNICHI_WEB
They had a clean image making helpful support machines, but they were totally different #NANNICHI_WEB
Just end the trial and make them pay #NANNICHI_WEB
Nothing will settle by calling Exoskeleton the bad guy. I think waiting for the trial is the right way to go. There is a chance that user is wrong #NANNICHI_WEB
Sold over 3,000,000 units and only about 100 cases of accidents and only 5-6 major accidents. Just looking at the numbers, I would agree if they told me it was the user #NANNICHI_WEB
HUG users are mainly the elderly. That is major key #NANNICHI_WEB
What is up with the people thinking they can dodge responsibility for the malfunction by saying the user used it wrong. You are telling us to ignore the fact that there is an issue that causes accidents on the HUG? #NANNICHI_WEB
Does anyone want to trade information about Kimijima Reports that're trending right now? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
What is this? A game? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
The flags being so difficult made me laugh #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
Does the report open by clearing the flags? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
What was written on it? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
I succeeded on opening report 1 but looks like there is a 2 lol #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
Can someone tell me whats on it? How many total? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
It's like a made up story about solar storms, NASA being part of a conspiracy theory, typical delusions #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
Who is KIMIJIMA #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
There wasn't a geotag like that until recently, right? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
Looks like there people talking about KIMIJIMA REPORTS overseas #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
The word started trending today #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
Maybe it's a promotion for a movie? #KIMIJIMA_REPORT
Blog updated -> Follow-up News! Kogoori Minami mysteriously disappeared in Tanegashima! #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/0217xx_
We received information from a person that worked at a car rental in 2015. Sounds like Kogoori Minami was seen there after disappearing from Tokyo. Now it's clear why Koujiro Frau is there #KUROKANE
The witness states that Kogoori looked like she was scared of something. It was about 3 month after the mysterious death of the 13 Gunvarrel staffers #KUROKANE
Witness was worried that Kogoori was acting weird and might attempt suicide. A couple days later a police officer who brought a picture of Kogoori came to talk to them. Looks like they came from Tokyo to look for a missing person #KUROKANE
But I have a question. Why would you take your time to come to Tanegashima to look for a person lost in Tokyo? Why not just report it to the police? The police officer from Tokyo is kind of suspicious #KUROKANE
Since then the whereabouts of Kogoori Minami has been a mystery. The rental that she borrowed was discovered parked outside a place called Appo Land. Unknown if any leads were left in the car #KUROKANE
And one more thing. There was a curious post on a thread on @channel about the same time as when Kogoori Minami got to Tanegashima, December 2015 #KUROKANE
Reporting. I saw 4 armed people at the Nagahama coast, maybe it's the US army practicing? I saw a runner boat so I think they came by that #KUROKANE
My intuition told me they are suspicious. The disappearance of Kogoori Minami I think is related to US army drill. I am confident that the armed men were Caucasian and not Asian #KUROKANE
I think I will continue to follow the Kogoori Minami case. Maybe we are getting close to the truth in this conspiracy theory #KUROKANE
Kurokane should appologize to Koujiro Frau #KUROKANE
Was there a source that Koujiro Frau isn't a terrioist? #KUROKANE
Kurokane, your skin is too thick #KUROKANE
If the info on the article is the truth, it matches the message from Kogoori Minami. Someone was getting chased!#KUROKANE
Or it can be another made up story by Kurokane, to match the story and to bash Kogoori Minami's family #KUROKANE
Why did Kogoori Minami go to Tanegashima? That island doesn't have much #KUROKANE
@NEXT4511 Maybe because there is nothing there #KUROKANE
Source is @channel? Is Kurokane playing with us? #KUROKANE
Speaking of Tanegashima, what happned to the rumors about the cold sleep experiment? #KUROKANE
@URBAN_CHAMPIONY62 Prolly fake news #KUROKANE
@URBAN_CHAMPIONY62 Cold sleep lol #KUROKANE
@URBAN_CHAMPIONY62 It's an urban legend #KUROKANE
Seems like recently Tanegashima gets all the attention. Like the rocket launch, there are lost more things making the news these days #KUROKANE
Just a coincidence #KUROKANE
Discovered all over the world, what are the Kimijima Reports? #SPORTS_TOHO #http://st.n/0217xx_
I read a copy of the reports, but I stopped halfway cause I got scared #SPORTS_TOHO
I see them everywhere, is it like a campaign for ‘IRUO.’ or something? If so, it's in bad taste #SPORTS_TOHO
I wonder if anyone cleared all of it. I'm trying for the flag for Report No. 6 #SPORTS_TOHO
The flags for Report No. 4 are too hard #SPORTS_TOHO
I read all 7 reports. No. 7 had no text though. I think that everyone should read this. At least till No. 6. Then you'll understand what the danger the world is facing #SPORTS_TOHO
We can't keep acting like this after reading the reports. So I am taking action, telling people about the reports, passing out flyers. Planning to do a march at the start of next month. I want everyone to participate #SPORTS_TOHO
It's fake news. People taking it seriously are crazy #SPORTS_TOHO
Who spread it? Kimijima Kou? #SPORTS_TOHO
So whoever opened Report No. 7 spread it? But when it got sent overseas it got translated to English, French, Portuguese, and even in Arabic. Who did the translations? #SPORTS_TOHO
Sensei excited for translations! #SPORTS_TOHO
Looking at the information provided, it correctly states what is going on. I can't believe it was written 10 years ago. Sounds like a prophecy. I would've laughed it away 10 years ago, but reading it now it gives me the chills #SPORTS_TOHO
There is nothing to prove that it was written 10 years ago. That's it #SPORTS_TOHO
Another solar storm is coming... #SPORTS_TOHO
Does the Committee of 300 really exist? They sound like the real culprit but can't find anything about them #SPORTS_TOHO
It was like a month ago, right? It spread out this much in a month... #SPORTS_TOHO
I believe the info on the reports. So there will be another solar storm coming. Fosure. Gotta prepare for it #SPORTS_TOHO
I want the government to do something #SPORTS_TOHO
If a magnetospheric substorm hit, it's going to be worse than last year's major blackout right? Someone do something #SPORTS_TOHO
If this many people read this, I'm pretty sure someone will deal with it #SPORTS_TOHO
What we can do is to spread the reports more and let more people know #SPORTS_TOHO
Finally, Tokyo Expo 2020 Is About to Start Tomorrow! Impactful Giant Robots Will Welcome You #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0221xx_
It's finally tomorrow!!! #TABOO_NEWS
I'm excited! Heading to Odaiba first thing in the morning! #TABOO_NEWS
Odaiba is going to be full of people #TABOO_NEWS
Just please remember the venues at Shinagawa and Toyosu too #TABOO_NEWS
If you want to enjoy stages from other countries go to Shinagawa and Toyosu, for the giant robots go to Odaiba #TABOO_NEWS
There is no reason not to go to Odaiba #TABOO_NEWS
This month the amount of people are gonna be crazy, need to schedule around golden week. Ugh I wanna go! #TABOO_NEWS
I envy the people living in the Kanto area. It's rough for those out in the country #TABOO_NEWS
They were showing the footage from the day before opening and the impact from seeing all those giant robots was crazy #TABOO_NEWS
Can they do a ROBO-ONE tournament using those giant robots lol #TABOO_NEWS
I wanna try to operate one, do they have that? #TABOO_NEWS
Hey don't be all jolly. I told you, Tokyo has not yet recovered from last year's solar storm! Tbh we shouldn't be running an Expo. Hurry and cancel it! #TABOO_NEWS
When the aqualiner opens up, you'll be able to go to Odaiba from Haneda and Narita nonstop. As a ComiMa regular that is super helpful #TABOO_NEWS
Hey, I was just looking at the phamplet and noticed this but who're Tanegashima Robotics Club? The discription states a giant robot created modeling Gunvarrel. I can't believe that they are bringing that propaganda anime to the Expo #TABOO_NEWS
I don't think they are reading the atmosphere bringing Gunvarrel right now. I mean I guess it can't be helped since they started building years ago #TABOO_NEWS
Gunvarrel has rumors that the staff mysteriously died and the director is still missing, right? It might get banned overseas #TABOO_NEWS
So rude to bring a robot modeled off a mecha anime full of scandals! People died! I'm gonna report them now. If they're still attending, I'll go there myself to destroy it! #TABOO_NEWS
The feel that there will be trouble #TABOO_NEWS
Tokyo Expo Opened, All 3 Venues Have Extreme Lines #ZACOZACO #http://zc.n/0222xx)_
You don't need robots. Who is going to stop them when they go out of control #TABOO_NEWS
My son is pumped from the morning lol This is my first time seeing my son with those shining eyes #ZACOZACO
Odaiba has too much people lol The popular CONDA and TAYOTA booths are like fully packed trains. Can't even move #ZACOZACO
Shinagawa and Toyosu look like they have fun stages but Odaiba is the first stop #ZACOZACO
You shouldn't go today. Even the aqualiner is packed #ZACOZACO
Last time there was a guy saying that the robot boom will die from the HUG accident. Is he alive? #ZACOZACO
The giant robots is amazing to see! Super amazing that they move too! #ZACOZACO
Feels like Gunbam came to real life! End of report #ZACOZACO
Finally, reallity caught up to anime! #ZACOZACO
Odaiba is full people, but you can rest in the corners of the venue. Check it out #ZACOZACO
There were some robots in maintenance and they kinda got me sad lol #ZACOZACO
I wanna go after seeing the posts from the people there! But tickets are expensive! #ZACOZACO
Today's News Evening 5 will be a special on the Tokyo Expo! Senomiya Misaki from Exoskeleton Company will be appearing as a guest! #FUJISUN_TV #http://fs.t/0226xx_
If Misaki-san is appearing live on FujisunTV, maybe she'll be at the Odaiba venue #FUJISUN_TV
I heard at the ExCo booth but they are having a special demonstration in the afternoon today #FUJISUN_TV
 ExCo Booth is Hosting a Special Demonstration in the Afternoon #FUJISUN_TV
Maybe Misaki-san herself is riding SUMERAGI at the special demonstration #FUJISUN_TV
What what what! Is it true that Misaki-san might appear at the Expo venue?! #FUJISUN_TV
Raw Misaki-san. Drools. Must go #FUJISUN_TV
We finally get to see her real position as a test pilot! And seeing it live! #FUJISUN_TV
Sounds like Misaki-san is doing the special demonstration! #FUJISUN_TV
Misaki-san is coming to Odaiba?! #FUJISUN_TV
 It appears that Misaki-san will be at the ExCo Booth at the Expo today #FUJISUN_TV
Hey, right now, that FujisunTV is interviewing Tanegashima Robotics Club. This Senomiya Akiho girl, isn't she Misaki-san's sister? #FUJISUN_TV
She was the runner up at last year's ROBO-ONE! #FUJISUN_TV
What... Senomiya Akiho-chan is participating in the Expo creating a giant robot #FUJISUN_TV
I thought I heard their name before. They're from RO41! I was sad that they were not in 42, but didn't think they'd be at the Expo! #FUJISUN_TV
They were Chuo Tanegashima High Robotics Research Club officially at ROBO-ONE. Wonder why they shortened their name. It was too long? #FUJISUN_TV
Misaki-san is beautiful, but Akiho-chan is cute #FUJISUN_TV
She doesn't have the san vibe. It felt right calling her chan #FUJISUN_TV
Her responses are so pure. A high school girl... Hehe #FUJISUN_TV
The rumors are that Senomiya Misaki is coming to Odaiba. If so, then both Senomiya sisters will be there #FUJISUN_TV
This is the chance to see the Senomiya sisters together! Not the time to be eating! #FUJISUN_TV
Hey, Odaiba is falling!
Odaiba is dead...
My husband and child are at the Expo venue in Odaiba and I cannot get in contact with them! Someone tell me what's going on!
Odaiba collapsing... are you serious
Look at Odaiba with ‘IRUO.’!
Self-Defense Force announced they are scrambling F-15s from Misawa base
Saw Odaiba through ‘IRUO.’ It's a disaster. Can't even laugh about it
Why is FujisunTV disconnected? Broadcast accident?
Are the people at Odaiba safe?!
How many thousands of people do you think are at Odaiba?! Can't believe this happened during the Expo!
That's why I said to cancel the Expo! Who is going to take responsibility!
What is that giant tower looking thing?
I can see a tower! It's huge!
Is that tower thing real? Not an AR?!
It's the end of the world!!!
What is happening?!
Why did it light up?! What is that tower?!
It's the Grand Obelisk
It's a space elevator! Did the Committee of 300 make it?
There is no way human science could create such a big thing
Odaiba is in trouble
Too unrealistic to have built secretly. Has to be a mirage!
But I really see it there! I really do!
This isn't reality, this isn't reality
My head is going crazy
It's the same as the anime. That leaked final episode!
It scares me when I compare the final episode of Gunvarrel to what's going on in reality
Is the world coming to an end? Please no
Odaiba has flooded
Senomiya Misaki started the terrorist attack! She is crazy!
Run. Run to a place where the solar storm won't hit!
Looks like the Grand Obelisk
 Grand Obelisk Comes to Life
The solar storm is here! Just like it said in the Kimijima Reports!
The Kimijima Reports were right!
This isn't a trick? Odiba is collapsing
Why didn't Kimijima-san tell us about this 10 years ago. Then this wouldn't have happened
Find the Committee of 300 and kill them
Someone call an ambulance! I am in Odaiba right now but my PokeCom isn't connecting!
What are the police and army doing?!
Did the government, police, and army resign to the Committee?!
What is that towerrrr?!
FujisunTV isn't showing up...
Because of Odaiba collapsing, maybe FujisunTV went down too...
The tower lit up!
Odaiba isn't collapsing
 Over 1000 planes in the air are now missing
The Expo venue has gone down!
A robot at the venue shot a missle and I ran for my life. It was like war. Thought I was gonna die
Barely made it out. Got stepped on and fell many times running from the venue in a panic
That is the space elevator in the anime. The Grand Obelisk!
There is no way a tower from an anime is real!
Why is everyone saying that Odaiba has collapsed? I am next to FujisunTV, but did something happen at the Expo?
There is smoke coming from the Expo venue. Loud noises too...
I was about to be killed by Misaki-san
I am currently in Odaiba, but only one part of it has collapsed
I'm at Odaiba. The phone isn't connecting but ‘IRUO.’ works. Please help me!
 Rainbow Bridge is closed
Young men are attacking the service robots @Ikebukuro
Solar storm! Another blackout!
All the signals are down!
The robot from Exoskeleton company went crazy!
FujisunTV is radio silent
The solar storm just happened! Everything is happening so fast...
Looks like the US 8th fleet is making an emergency dispatch
Minato, Tokyo is completely blacked out. Public transportation has completely stopped
Maybe it's weaker than last year's solar storm. My PokeCom is fine this time
My phone is dead! Why didn't the phone company deal with this!
The train stopped. They are announcing that they don't know when it be back up
Can't do this... Can the solar storms just disappear
It's the ghost that lives in ‘IRUO.’'s fault
In Kawasaki! Someone wearing the HUG has suddenly attacked a pregnant woman! The ground is covered in blood!
Not just Tokyo. The whole world is in chaos
If it's what the Kimijima Reports said, then the magnetospheric substorm is gonna hit and the world will end! Somone do something!
NA, EU, the Middle East are all having disasters
Is it true that the private jet for the US president when down?!
The robots are going out of control again!
The terrorist behind the November attack hasn't been caught yet right?!
The robots are still moving. They are marching in the middle of the street in Shinjuku... So scary... I might get killed...
The phone isn't connecting again, dammit!
Robot from ExCo is going crazy and killing the visitors!
 There is a chance that all service robots may go out of control
This is just the beginning. And only the beginning. After this a magnetospheric substorm is going to hit. Then the world will end
I got a report from my sister studying abroad that another riot started on the west coast of the US
This isn't reality. It's just gossip. Gonna go sleep
A nuclear missile was discovered as a disguised rocket in Jiuguan, China
Blog Updated -> Another truth has emerged. There is another culprit behind the mysterious deaths of the Gunvarrel staff #KUROKANE #http://fk.f/0227xx_
After doing some research on my own, I found out something. With the state we are in right now, telling the police won't do anything. Rather, I think there are police covering up the truth about this conspiracy theory. So I have decided to report it here #KUROKANE
I thought that 13 people died and Kogoori Minami fled the scene from the studio of the Gunvarrel anime. But I was wrong #KUROKANE
There were 15 people at the scene, not 14. This is the truth I found out in the past few days. This will put myself at risk, but as journalist I am going to publicly announce that person's name #KUROKANE
His name is Hoshita Sakae. He was the CEO of Happiness4U at the time and currently is the CEO of a lease company, HOSITA. Also, Happiness4U was a sponsor for Gunvarrel near the end of the series #KUROKANE
HOSHITA has a executive named Morris Libron, an military man from Gloire Service, a known French military enterprise. That Libron is a security guard for Hoshita #KUROKANE
On the last day Kogoori Minami was seen on Tanegashima, eyewitnesses reported seeing armed foreigners. From testimony, their attire matched the security uniform of Gloire Services. Perhaps they landed on the island to search for Kogoori Minami? #KUROKANE
That is an overview of the information that I know now. After this disaster has calmed down, I plan to have an interview with Hoshita #KUROKANE
Again Kurokane is going crazy #KUROKANE
What is Kurokane doing at a time like this. Is he stupid? #KUROKANE
Hey that GS Fr. that Koujiro Frau was talking about. Isn't that the initials for Gloire Service? And Fr. means France I think #KUROKANE
@SHIO_SATO A genius arrives #KUROKANE
Is Kurokane-san tweeping because he is certain that the real culprit is the person named Hoshita? If not it's defamation. Typical from him but still #KUROKANE
HOSHITA is invested in companies called TAIYO Development and Commit. Both have made their way to Tanegashima #KUROKANE
@FK_CONA Are you Koujiro Frau herself? Did you move to Tanegashima to research your mother's disappearance? #KUROKANE
Speaking of Happiness4U, the popular Kimijima Kou was a founding member. I guess he is the one who created ‘IRUO.’ #KUROKANE
I heard that Kimijima Kou was killed 10 years ago in Tanegashima #KUROKANE
Kogoori Minami and Kimijima Kou both in Tanegashima #KUROKANE
Seems like Kogoori Minami was trying to meet Kimijima Kou. Even though he was already gone in 2015 #KUROKANE
Did Kimijima Kou run to Tanegashima because he knew the other face of Hoshita? But still got killed? #KUROKANE
Yesterday, I called the Kagoshima and Tanegashima police department before the solar storm hit. They both said that there were no research reports on Furugoori Minami. This is all Kurokane's delusions #KUROKANE
Kurokane's actions are getting worse. Fosure he's making stuff up. I don't think he'll ever do an interview, there's no way to book one in this disaster. Don't take Kurokane too seriously #KUROKANE
I feel that the people bashing Kurokane is desperate. Maybe they are just undercover #KUROKANE
I found a crazy article on TABOO! #KUROKANE
Man Gets Stabbed at a Restaurant Located in Kabuki-Cho, Shinjuku #TABOO_NEWS #http://tn.o/0227xx_ #KUROKANE
>Person that died is CEO of HOSHITA Co., Ltd. Hoshita Sakae 46 years old. The suspect is Hiroshi Hamanashi, a joblesss 24 year old. He states his PokeCom told him to kill the man. Currently investigating #TABOO_NEWS Hey, is this... #KUROKANE
Hoshita is dead? Seriously? #KUROKANE
When is this article from? #KUROKANE
Yesterday morning, so must have happened between midnight of the 26th and the morning of 27th #KUROKANE
This murder case was treated as a small case due to the solar storm issue, but isn't this pretty bad? #KUROKANE
Hoshita was erased #KUROKANE
High chance that Hoshita was erased. Tokyo locals are cray. It's like a drama #KUROKANE
It feels like I am in a movie considering the fall of Odaiba... #KUROKANE
Maybe what Kurokane-san is saying is the truth... #KUROKANE
But if Hoshita was erased, does that mean there is someone behind Hoshita? Maybe Happiness4U? #KUROKANE
Must be related to Project Atum. It's the Committee of 300 #KUROKANE
If we keep on talking about this we might be erased... Kinda scary #KUROKANE
Hey, looks like something is happening in Tanegashima #KUROKANE
Tanegashima... #KUROKANE
Few hours ago, a local in Tanegashima was doing a NicoLive. They were building a giant robot. Also last year's runner up Senomiya Akiho and Koujiro Frau were seen together #KUROKANE
What do you mean? The conspiracy theory is moving toward Tanegashima? #KUROKANE
Wasn't Senomiya Akiho at the Expo yesterday? #KUROKANE
A life-size Gunvarrel made by high schoolers will fight to save the world or something like that #KUROKANE
Up'd the capture image. That is the robot #http://upss.n/0228xx_ #KUROKANE
Just saw it, but what is that papier-mâché #KUROKANE
Are they playing around in this situation? #KUROKANE
What is happening in Tanegashima? #KUROKANE
The rumors are that a black hole is going to appear in Tanegashima and the world is in trouble #KUROKANE
Black hole lololol Yes lolol the world is in trouble lolol #KUROKANE
I read a post that JAXA got taken over #KUROKANE
When I hear about Tanegashima, I imagine the Committee of 300 #KUROKANE
Kurokane needs to fly to Tanegashima now! #KUROKANE
Haneda and Narita are both closed. No planes are flying #KUROKANE
What are they trying to do with the papier-mâché? If the world is in danger, why don't they ask the police or self-defense forces or even the US army in Okinawa #KUROKANE
In this situation I don't think any of them would listen to a story that may not be true #KUROKANE
I fully support them because Senomiya Akiho-chan is CUTE #KUROKANE
You remember the boy that was with Senomiya Akiho at ROBO-ONE? As a person who was amazed by his operating skills, I want him to do a good job #KUROKANE
I request a live broadcast. Then I'll watch #KUROKANE
