Mitchie leaves after telling us that he still had to help with the funeral service.
Akiho and I decide to swing by Subaru's house.
Akiho wanted this.
She needs to go to his dad and make things right.
When she told me her intentions, I didn't try to stop her.
We didn't get to see him at the hospital, so we haven't actually seen Subaru since the accident.
From what I understand, his dad told the nurses not to let the Robotics Club or anyone related see his son.
It's only natural for him to be that angry.
Subaru may be permanently injured because we forced him to join the club.
Subaru's injury is a comminuted fracture.
They're still considering what surgery to do.
Whether he'll be able to walk, do any sports, or any exercise at all depends on the surgery and rehab.
After having the giant Model-2 fall on him, the doctors said he was lucky to get away with just a broken leg.
Not that that's any consolation.
Anyhow, the reason we're visiting is simple.
Akiho is in charge of apologizing. I'm in charge of getting hit. That's all.
My role in this sucks, and even Akiho tried her best to convince me not to come.
But I can't risk him laying a hand on her.
Though I highly doubt that Subaru's dad would do something like that to a young lady.
But I'm still here as her shield, just in case.
Anyway, we park our scooters at the Otatsu Metatsu Rocks lot near his house, and get ready to charge in, when...
Junna: “Uugh... Sniff... Uuh...”
Akiho: “Huh? Jun?!”
We encounter Junna, crying and slowly trudging away from the direction of Subaru's house.
She's alone.
We sit her down on a nearby bench to try and calm her down.
Kaito: “Jun-chan, are you here because you went to Subaru's house?”
Junna: “Yeah...”
Akiho: “Did you see his dad?”
Junna: “Yes, because... because it was all my fault...!”
Junna: “I knew I had to apologize...”
Junna: “I got down on the ground and told him I'd do anything...”
Junna: “But he... he...”
Junna: “All he said to me was...”
Junna: “‘I know it's not your fault.’”
Junna: “‘I know that, but please don't involve yourself with my son anymore.’”
Junna: “And then... he made me leave...”
Kaito: “...”
That's unexpected. I thought he'd be more angry.
I mean, we saw the man punch his son with our own eyes.
That image is so strong that I just kind of figured he was a violent guy.
Junna: “It would've... been better if he'd just hit me...”
Junna: “Hidaka-kun's dad looked so lonely...”
Junna: “After seeing his face... I couldn't even apologize anymore...”
Junna: “But it doesn't change the fact... that it's all my fault...!”
Junna: “Even if Hidaka-kun's dad forgave me, I'd never be able to forgive myself!”
Junna: “I always, no matter what I do... I always ruin everything...!”
Akiho: “Jun, calm down...”
Akiho: “I saw what happened. I know it's not your fault.”
Akiho: “It really was the wind. It was totally out of your control.”
Akiho: “Okay? So, don't torment yourself over this and—”
Junna: “I can't stop!”
Junna slaps Akiho's hand away.
She doesn't even try to wipe the tears covering her face.
Junna: “I'm sorry, Akiho-chan, Yashio-kun...”
Junna: “I can't be around you guys anymore.”
Junna: “This is all my fault. None of you did anything wrong...”
Junna: “If I quit the Robotics Club, things will—”
Kaito: “That'd be pointless, Jun-chan.”
Junna: “...Huh?”
Kaito: “...There is no Robotics Club anymore.”
Junna: “N...o...”
Ah, crap...
I shouldn't have said that.
Akiho: “Y-You idiot!”
Akiho: “Is now really the time to say that?!”
She's exactly right.
I've made a huge mistake.
Junna: “It's my fault...”
Junna: “Because of me... Akiho-chan's dreams, our Expo entry, the Robotics Club's legacy... everything... it's all gone...”
Junna: “If I... wasn't the operator...”
Kaito: “No, Jun-chan. Calm down.”
Junna: “I'm sorry. I-I...”
Junna: “Uugh...”
Once again, large tears start falling from Junna's eyes.
Junna: “I'm sorry...”
Junna: “I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...”
Junna: “Waaaah...”
Kaito: “...”
Akiho: “Jun...”
As Junna wails, Akiho reaches her arms around her and hugs her tightly.
But neither me nor Akiho have any words to offer her.
In the end, no matter what we say, they're just words.
We should leave Junna be until she calms down. We can talk to her again later.
As for Subaru's father, we probably shouldn't try to see him anymore...
