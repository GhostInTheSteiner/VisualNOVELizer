Kimijima Report No.1

Report No.1
This report will serve as a backup in the event that I am killed. Someone is threatening me. They are cleverly concealing themselves, yet I perceive a psychological and mental oppression against me; it is likely an assault from electromagnetic wave weaponry. I do not know when you are reading this—perhaps the One World Order has already been established by the time you are. Nonetheless, it is likely that I will no longer be a part of this world. I will impart here the truth should such an occurrence come to pass.
NASA is hiding an important truth from the public andhas refused to report it. The Ulysses Project was not just about researching the Sun. In November of 2000, while NASA was studying the Sun's antarctic circle, they witnessed an unexplainable occurrence in its magnetic activity. Magnetic monopoles undeniably existedthere—yes, much like those often explored in science fiction! However, NASA laughed it off, claiming it was fraudulent. They utilized the media to thoroughly broadcast propaganda all across the world, makingpeople believe the partially leaked truth was a complete fabrication. This incident of information control was no doubt operated from behind the scenes by Tavistock. In the end, their propaganda succeeded. As of the current year, 2009, the discovery of the monopole has been reduced to an urban legend. However, this is the truth: the Sun is on the verge of producing several discharges. According to scientific evidence, there will be successive major solar storms that will occur in 2012, 2015, 2019, and 2020, all of which will severely affect the Earth and its magnetosphere. If you believe this to be a lie, I request that you look up at the night sky past the year 2012. If you do so, you will see auroras occurring all over the world. NASA holds detailed, incredibly grave data regarding the solar storm forecast, but will continue to conceal it due to external pressure from certain organizations. The solar storm in 2012 will be said to have never happened, and there will be several institutions that will utilize the solar storm as a part of their terrorist plots. This can be expected particularly in 2015, which is when an extremely large solar storm will hit. Warnings are meaningless. It cannot be stopped unless they are prosecuted. Unbeknownst to the world, an unseen force from the Sun will arrive and bring about a crisis on a global scale. No information will be provided. Many people will be killed.But that is merely the trigger. Taking advantage of the chaos, a much greater threat will present itself: a secret project that will slowly bring about the collapse of human society in its entirety.

Report No.2
The secret society that placed pressure on NASA is one whose ranks consist of a mere 300. It is the organization that is believed to control the world from the shadows.
Their existence is said to not extend past the realm of rumor, but allow me to be perfectly clear. The ones known as the “Invisible Rulers”—the Committee of300—undeniably exist.
Almost the entire world bends to their will, whether it be governments, state agencies, police, military, royalty, large corporations—particularly banking enterprises—and any other institutions that are vital to society’s function. They control all of the necessary mediums that are vital to society’s construction. Naturally, this includes NASA as well. This is how they have managed to continually suppress all information regarding the Ulysses Project that I mentioned previously. Falsifying official NASA documents is easier than lifting a finger for the Committee of 300.
In 1994, the Tavistock Institute made national headlines when it announced its official partnership with NASA on a major program. Of course, Tavistock operates under the Committee of 300 as well. They are often referred to by the Committee as the “brainwashing institute.” According to official U.S. documentation, Tavistock has conspired with intelligence agencies of various countries in order to broadcast propaganda on a daily basis. It would be appropriate to dub this a form of mass brainwashing. The issue lies in the fact that those affected are rarely made aware that they have been and continue to be brainwashed, and before they ever come to realize such, they have already become livestock for the One World Order—the Committee of 300’s true goal. I do wonder how many of the people that walk the Earth are aware of the “Human Domestication Project,” but regardless of my musings, the project exists and is still progressing even now.
It would not be wrong to surmise that a prototypeversion of the project is being tested around the world. Various experiments are secretly, but certainly, being carried out throughout daily life. This danger is not one we may avert our eyes from. Pay special attention to“Kagome Kagome.” The song serves as a sort of symbol to them; wherever they experiment, that song will undoubtedly be present.
The Human Domestication Project is the ultimate goal that the Committee of 300 has been dreaming of for nearly a hundred years. They wish to establish a One World Order—a unified world government—by cleaving the world's population down to one billion people (it is currently six billion as of 2009) and transforming all that remain into cattle that shall be exploited until death in the service of the Elite.
Those billion people will never be made aware of their enslavement due to the utilization of propaganda. Intruth, they may even express gratitude to their rulers.

11/12/2009
I created Airi to investigate the activity of the Committee of 300. She is a bot that collects any information that is related to the keyword “Committee of 300” indiscriminately. Recently, there has been an extraordinary amount of feedback originating from the Shibuya area. The earthquake that occurred there may have been one of their experiments as well, but it is doubtful whether I will even live to analyze the information my bot has collected.
Report No.3
I still vividly recall February 1st, 2010—the day the President of the United States announced the termination of the Constellation Project.
His statement contained the following information:
“The funds that were previously allocated to the Constellation Program will be repurposed primarily to allow for robot-led space exploration missions. Furthermore, they will also be used to support the development of manned rockets by private enterprises. Finally, a portion of the funds will be set aside for future use in order to fund the development of next-generation engines that will send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit and into deep space.”
That is what was said to the public. However, very few know it was all merely in preparation for Project Atum.
Project Atum—spearheaded by the TavistockInstitute—was approved by the group they are operating under, the Committee of 300, as No. 114 in their attempts regarding the Human Domestication Project.
After Project Noah ended in failure in 2009, this project was seen as a similarly promising venture by the Committee of 300.
Specifically, it will directly interfere with the Sun at its period of maximum activity, artificially generate a solar corona, and then release it as a solar magnetic storm. The resulting solar storm would be the largest in recorded history. Expected damages would be the annihilation of roughly half of the human population, as well as massive changes to the global environment that would further increase the number of deceased. The ultimate goal is to end the lives of five billion people.
The project was founded based on research from NASA that predicted the Sun would enter a ten-year-long period of maximum activity beginning in 2012, which was recognized by Tavistock and then propagated shortlyafter. This was performed by deliberately leaking NASA’s research worldwide, and in 2009, the Hollywood film known as “2012” was produced in order to associate the year 2012 with the apocalypse.
Also in 2009, the Committee of 300 learned from a report by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) that the reason for the Sun's increased activity was the influence of an interstellar-sized energy ribbon (cosmic string) drawing close to the solar system. Project Atum was further adjusted as a result, and they moved to execute the plan in 2015.
The Committee recognizes that the execution of Project Atum would wreak havoc across the Earth, sothey plan to provide wealthy people connected to the Committee of 300 refuge in shelters either on the Moonor deep underground. Thanks to the spread of carbon nanotubes, the possibility of constructing a space elevator from geostationary orbit to the Moon is being considered by the Committee, which would eliminate the need to travel there by rocket. However, due to the low prospect of completion by 2015, the construction of underground shelters is currently the more realistic option.
For several years after 2015, the surface of the Earth would be nearly uninhabitable due to the environmental changes; the only planned activity on the surface would be performed by livestock (including humans) as well as the autonomous robots managing them.
Project Mars—running concurrently with ProjectAtum—will have a large selection of companies serving under the Committee of 300 develop and build robots no later than 2012. This explosive technological progress will make autonomous, life-sized robots commonplace by2015, and once this is achieved, research on giant robots for military use will commence shortly after.I will discuss Project Mars separately, but know this: all manufacturers that were unheard of in 2009 but become top global corporations by 2015 will all be connected directly to the Committee of 300. Japan's Exoskeleton, America's U.S. Robocom, and the United Kingdom's Liverpool Tech all must be given particular attention.
Report No.4
There is not a single company that is more familiar with propaganda than the Tavistock Institute. The institute alone possesses at least one century's worth of research at minimum.
The true value and purpose of such knowledge displayed itself in the 1900s during World War I and World War II.
What the Institute does is guide individuals to follow in the direction of the group's will and to abandon theirown. The success of such guidance can be attributed to the government’s assistance during wartimes, but when utilized in times of peace, it proved far less effective.
Realizing this, they withdrew and began research intohow to subtly invade the unconscious of man in everyday life.
Utilizing this knowledge, it becomes obvious that the Committee of 300 was able to control major media networks all over the world thanks to their connections with Tavistock.
The subliminal messages one would find on various TV broadcasts—the ones that faced controversy for atime—were an immature prototype of propaganda that barely qualified as brainwashing. In recent years, they have abandoned such practices, instead electing to wait in the shadows for any opportunity to guide the minds of men as they go about their everyday lives.
This is not something to be dismissed merely as someoneelse's problem. This is something that applies to you who are reading this report as well. You are in a position where you must take great caution in your everydaylife. No matter where they lie, they will erode everyone and everything.
This battle is not being fought on a massive scale in manners such as public opinion, but on the level of individual consciousness.
You have to understand that the ideas you thought you decided on of your own volition were instead chosen for you while they peered into your thoughts. It is dangerous to trust your own thoughts one hundred percent of the time. I would recommend that you decentralize your thoughts to reduce the risk of brainwashing.
My predictions are not ones that can be applied to the societal level, but only to the personal level.
Although data-sharing systems via cloud computing are essential to society's infrastructure, neither corporations nor media truly know the serious danger lurking within.
Despite the fact that all risks that were previously decentralized have now been concentrated in a single location, the standards of computer security remain unchanged. Because of this, major leaks of personal information are inevitable, and these standards must be acknowledged and addressed quickly in order to avoid such occurrences.
Project Mars is, in essence, unaffiliated with Project Atum; it is merely a project running parallel to it, and both projects are authored by the Committee of 300. Should circumstances permit it, there is a chance both projects will be combined to perform simultaneous terrorist attacks. If that were to happen, human society would plunge deeper and deeper into chaos.
As of 2009, Project Mars does not pose a threat. The project is still in its experimental stages, but within ten to twenty years from now, the situation will undoubtedly change.
I truly hope that society has not been inundated with the horrifying entities known as robots, but my fear lies in the fact that the Tavistock Institute is capable of tricking every human being on Earth into believing their presence to be a popular trend, so such an event is indeed possible.
The primary objective of Project Mars is a roboticuprising. It is a vulgar idea that seems as if it was ripped straight from a science fiction novel, but you cannot foolishly disregard it or laugh it off as such. Depending on the situation, robots could easily replace humans.
If Project Atum were to fail in 2015, the next major solar storms are predicted to arrive in 2019 and 2020. Afterthat, the Sun will enter a period of stability for a short while.
In other words, this period of maximum solar activity is a convenient trigger for the Committee of 300. It would not be an incorrect assumption to say that for the next decade, Earth will be a favorable testing ground for the Committee of 300.
You need to be suspicious of abnormal weather phenomena and, if possible, collect data of any unusual instances that do occur. Such data will surely show traces of Tavistock.
Report No.5
With the increase in solar activity, it will becomepossible—particularly in low altitude regions—to observe the aurora worldwide, shifting HAARP into the public eye.
HAARP, of course, refers to the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program.
By irradiating high-power electromagnetic waves, this program researches activity and the effects on wireless communication through stimulation of the ionosphere. However, the unmistakable fact that the U.S. army is a part of this “military project” is a major reason as to why HAARP has not been cleared of suspicion. 
Ever-ridiculous thoughts, which perhaps incidentally approach the core goals of HAARP, have been shared worldwide by conspiracy theorists.
 For example, there is a theory that by irradiating electromagnetic waves with the strength of one trillion watts, you can assign the weather, control minds, and even generate artificial earthquakes.
As another example, there is a theory that meddling with the ionosphere may generate a high-energy laser weapon capable of attacking each and every city.
This myriad of ridiculous theories crafted from robust imaginations overshadow the alarm bell which is the one original truth, and the consolidation of every theory results only in their mockery with thoughts of “What in the world are you talking about?”
But do not be misled. There is a high possibility that all these absurd theories have been forged by Tavistock, with the intent of employing them as clever camouflage.
They will create a forest to hide a single tree; that is the way of the Tavistock Institute, and the oldest trick in the book of propaganda.
First and foremost, it is obvious that HAARP—which ostensibly irradiates the ionosphere with electromagnetic waves—was not meant to target the Earth itself.
But, that is not all.
HAARP's very nature was converted when NASA and the Committee of 300 received the probe results from the Ulysses Project. Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I said it became a part of Project Atum.
The surface temperature of the Sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius, yet the solar corona is heated to several million degrees Celsius, radiating from the solar surface into the solar magnetosphere. Around the year 2007, the principle of this heating was determined to be the magnetic reconnection phenomenon.
In other words, given the close proximity of the north and south poles of the Sun, the opposing magnetic field lines of the Sun's surface and the above corona come in contact, resulting in an extraordinarily unstable state. Both magnetic field lines have the tendency to connect and grow shorter, at which time extreme amounts of energy are released at upward of tens of thousands of degrees Celsius. 
This magnetic reconnection is happening frequently not only on the solar surface, but in the solar magnetosphere as well. Born from magnetic reconnection, explosive phenomena in outer space will be frequent occurrences, especially during the maximum period of activity ending in 2020.
But this distant danger is not one to avert our eyes from.
The solar magnetosphere is closely related to the geomagnetosphere. Magnetic reconnection in the solar magnetosphere has profound effects on the geomagnetosphere. Solar storms perform the role of carrying the Sun's atmosphere and plasma to the geomagnetosphere in the form of high-speed jet streams. Should the plasma collide with the geomagnetosphere, it is possible for a magnetic reconnection phenomenon to occur.
It is imperative to understand that the aurora is also generated by the energy created from the heat and acceleration of the plasma.
Should this magnetic reconnection—namely a magnetospheric substorm—occur within the geomagnetosphere, then the Earth will sustain critical damage far beyond the capabilities of any normal solar storm—damages large enough to drive all of humanity toward collapse.
Project Atum is a deplorable plan capable of artificially inducing these conditions, and HAARP is merely a single gear in its machinations.
Human hands may not be able to harness the power of the gigantic Sun, but within the geomagnetosphere, such a thing is possible. At least, that is what the Committeeof 300 believes.
Report No.6
The technique of manipulating media to spin tales confusing reality and fiction is already outdated. In the 21st century, propaganda must be carved into the hearts of men by augmenting those fantasies upon reality. An exceedingly gentle and clever silence will fall as all sense of reality is lost. The Committee of 300 calls this their “Silent Weapon.”
In less than two decades, wars fought with tanks and missiles will become obsolete, and even nuclear weaponry will become antique.
War will be carried out in total secrecy, beginning in an unknown location, and ending in a one-sided massacre that will never be broadcast. The hearts of men will be quietly invaded, eroded, violated, and eventually killed.
This is the nature of the “Silent Weapon.” It is a deplorable creation that reaches far beyond propaganda, robbing men of their dignity with incredible ease. The age of direct control over a man’s will has already arrived.
It is within the realm of scientific possibility to project nonexistent fabrications upon the eyes of men. America's Viktor Chondria University developed VR (VisualRebuilding) technology long ago and received official patent documentation for it. The brains of all men contain a will shaped by nerve impulses, or, more simply, electronic signals. Consequently, if artificial nerve impulses were to interfere with the optic nerve, even delusions can be augmented upon reality. This technology has evolved far past the initial limits of AR, and as such, it carries the potential to improve human life, but only if its use remains peaceful. Such a hope has long sincebeen abandoned.
Research has already progressed to ruling overhuman will by way of VR technology, namely through simultaneous hallucinatory projections upon the masses.This is, of course, pioneered by the Tavistock Institute.
Project Noah was approved by the Committee of 300 as No. 86 in their attempts regarding the Human Domestication Project. It was lent engineering prowess by Tavistock as Japan's Nozomi Technology Ltd. shifted into execution of large-scale, indiscriminate human experimentation in Shibuya, Tokyo.
It should be obvious that such electromagnetic weaponry was the cause of the earthquakes in that city and yet, regardless of the unnatural circumstances surrounding the earthquakes, not a soul dares to come forth in opposition of its legitimacy. Does this not seem odd? If you do not believe so, then Tavistock is controlling your will as well. 
A collective will crafted from lost autonomy, an electromagnetic weapon capable of even earthquakes, and solar storms reaching incredibly high activity. Upon the day that all conditions are met, the trumpets announcing the end will echo across the world. A small group of powerful men will initiate Project Atum, ushering in the thorough slaughter of mankind and providing the group with their livestock. These opportunities will arise thrice: 2015, 2019, and 2020. Tread with caution, for it may already be too late.

3/29/2010
You have my gratitude for reading thus far. I must say that during your time with these reports, you have been incredibly perseverant, or perhaps greatly and deeply inquisitive. It would likely not be incorrect to surmise that your heart delights in righteousness. But again, I ask for you to tread carefully. If they learn you are reading this, your life becomes forfeit.
This series of reports is the indictment I have written whilst in hiding from assassins of the Committee of 300. Surely by the time you read this, I will have long since disappeared from this world. However, by any means possible, this deplorable conspiracy must be halted. Furthermore, there is a favor I must ask. If you believe in me, then I beg you to find the seventh report. The seventh report alone is the key, and when obtained, it is set to scatter the six other reports worldwide by way of‘IRUO.’ Naturally, such a manner of diffusion could never have its source determined. At the time I am writing this report in 2010, ‘IRUO.’ is still in its prototype stage. However, if it is given another five to ten years, then I believe that people throughout the world will make use of it, and I am relying on such.
The reports shall serve as anti-propaganda against Tavistock. In the societies of the 21st century, the spreading of information is instantaneous, and once seeds are sown, there is no way to stop their growth. However, one mustn’t imitate Tavistock, who crafts forests to hide trees.
And now, the time has come to choose.
I leave everything in your hands. If you feel these indictments hold weight as reality, then obtain the seventh report. If you do not, then dispose of these reports at once.
I pray that there will be readers who progress this far, and I am truly grateful if you have already done so.
I can only hope your era remains free of conspiracy. 
I leave Airi in your care.
