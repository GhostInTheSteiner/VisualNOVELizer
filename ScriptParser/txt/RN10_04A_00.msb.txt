Kaito: “...”
It didn't take long for all the excitement to take its toll on Akiho. She's fast asleep.
Akiho: “...”
Man, she looks totally defenseless like that...
She never even considered the possibility that I could attack her while she was sleeping.
Of course, it's not like I WOULD do that or anything.
...Goddammit. Look at me getting all nervous thanks to Mitchie's carefree ass. I'll never get to the top if something like this affects me. Hell, Nae-san'll probably pass me.
Akiho: “Zzz... Mm...”
Akiho: “Big... Sis...”
Kaito: “...”
This girl really does have a sister complex.
I impulsively stroke her cheek ever so gently. She's just too adorable.
Her cheek is warm, soft, and silky smooth.
Kaito: “I hope you get to see Misa-nee tomorrow...”
Akiho: “Mm...”
Then, Akiho suddenly grabs the hand I was using to stroke her cheek with both hands.
Kaito: “Are you up?”
Akiho: “Mmnyaa...”
Kaito: “...”
She's fast asleep.
She starts brushing her cheek against my hand. She's like a cat...
Given how comfy she looks, I decide to leave her be.
I want to get some sleep myself, but I'm not actually that tired yet.
I guess I'll just play some KB and—
Kaito: “...Oh.”
Right. I can't play Kill-Ballad with one hand.
Kaito: “Now that's just great...”
I sigh and close my eyes.
As much as I want to, maybe it'll be nice to get some sleep without playing KB, just this once.
