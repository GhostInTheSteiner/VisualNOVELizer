The next day.
I rouse Frau out of bed first thing in the morning, and we head to the swamp where the Kandelia obovata are located.
Activating the flag requires me to take a picture of the flower and upload it.
I looked it up beforehand, and apparently the Kandelia obovata flower blooms at the beginning of summer.
Since we're right in the middle of the season, I was worried there wouldn't be any flowers left.
I remove my shoes and step into the swamp—I say “swamp,” but it's half dry—and start checking the Kandelia obovata.
I make Frau help, but only 10 minutes go by before she starts complaining. I end up doing the work myself.
After about an hour, I finally find the flower in question and grab a snapshot.
As soon as I upload it, it's displayed in ‘IRUO.’
Three hours of pain and suffering await me in that cave in the afternoon.
But this time, I made Frau help. The flag requires three straight days with the same PokeCom.
So we take turns every 30 minutes to make it more bearable.
The tide again starts to rise midway through, causing Frau to loudly panic as the waves cover our feet.
