Kaito: “...”
After eating supper, I lie down in the center of my bedroom.
There's a lot I need to think about.
The monopoles.
The fact that I got forced into being Model-2's operator.
The fact that the Kill-Ballad cheaters have been dead for half a year.
The final episode of Gunvarrel.
What I want to do after high school.
But...
Today, I have only one thing on my mind.
I've been thinking about it since dinner and even when I was in the bath.
I've been replaying a simulation of my battle against Nae-san in my head over and over again.
How would Nae-san go on the offensive?
How should I approach her?
Based on the limited information I gathered from our two matches from earlier, I try to predict her patterns.
Even this very moment.
When I close my eyes, I can recreate Nae-san's Boltvalian moves.
I ridiculously underestimated her.
As good as I think I am, I've still got a ways to go.
After all, I'm second in the world.
The next time we play, I have to show her what I'm really made of.
You get the idea.
I've basically only been thinking about Nae-san all day.
It's almost like I've fallen in love with her or something.
I chuckle at the thought.
