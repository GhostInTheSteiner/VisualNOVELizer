Mizuka: “Yeah, they left on the last flight of the night.”
Mizuka: “They'll be arriving tonight and spending the night.”
Misaki: “Just the two of them?”
Mizuka: “No, Mitchie went along as the chaperone. Although he's probably the one that needs watching.”
Misaki: “I see.”
Mizuka: “They've been busy over the last two weeks. I expect that from Aki, but I haven't seen Kai like that in a while.”
Mizuka: “Sounds like they're dealing with some crazy conditions. But hey, they're definitely giving it their all.”
Mizuka: “Ah, to be young again. Hee hee.”
Mizuka: “When I saw them today, they looked like they'd had all their demons taken out of them. It was pretty refreshing.”
Mizuka: “I guess Kai actually decided to help out at the Robotics Club for once. I wonder what caused his change of heart?”
Mizuka: “Ah, crud, I'm just blabbing on and on by myself.”
Mizuka: “You're planning to meet them over there, right?”
Misaki: “I'm not.”
Mizuka: “What?! Why not?”
Misaki: “...I'm busy.”
Mizuka: “You're busy? I get it, but still...”
Mizuka: “Aki's been real lonely, you know? You should see the look on her face whenever she says she can't get ahold of you.”
Mizuka: “I just wanna give her a hug when I see her like that.”
Mizuka: “Have you not talked to your little sister at all lately? Even just a little?”
Misaki: “...”
Mizuka: “...This is exactly what I'm talking about.”
Mizuka: “She's a good girl. Hell, I wish I had a little sister like her.”
Misaki: “Yes.”
Mizuka: “Geez, you're so cold. Well, whatever... So? How about making some time to say hi at least?”
Misaki: “I told you. I'm busy.”
Mizuka: “Yeah, I heard you, but you need to think about yourself, too. Hell, I bet you don't even got a man in your life.”
Misaki: “You're one to talk, Mizu.”
Mizuka: “Oh? You sounded like your old self again for a second. Did you finally wake up?”
Misaki: “...”
Mizuka: “Are you eating properly? You aren't leaving your place a mess, are you?”
Mizuka: “You've always been messy like that.”
Mizuka: “I'd love to tell all your old dude fans about the ‘real’ Senomiya Misaki. Hee hee hee.”
Mizuka: “Just joking. Either way, make some time to see your cute underclassmen in their hour of triumph, got it?”
Misaki: “...I need to get going. I'm dining together with a few clients soon.”
Mizuka: “Gotcha. I'll be sure to ring you up again. See ya.”
Mizuka: “...”
Mizuka: “So, you really don't ever plan on coming back, eh?”
Mizuka: “Aki and Kai aren't the only ones feeling lonely...”
