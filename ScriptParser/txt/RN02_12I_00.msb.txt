Even at a jog, the abandoned hotel that Yashio-senpai spoke of takes less than three minutes to reach.
Stationed at the entrance are brand-new surveillance cameras and an intercom. Completely out-of-place on this building.
I try pressing the intercom button.
The ringing sound reverberates through the interior of the building.
I guess the electricity is working.
A reply comes quickly.
Frau: “What's the password?”
A girl's voice.
I can't believe she actually lives in this abandoned building.
People always say that geniuses tend to be eccentric weirdos.
Does she have terrible tastes, or is she just an idiot?
Judging by her words and actions on the day she transferred, she seems to be a gloomy person.
I hold back a sigh of exasperation.
Subaru: “Hello, Furugoori Kona-san. I'm Hidaka from your class—”
Subaru: “...”
For some reason, she hangs up immediately.
I try pressing the button again.
Subaru: “...”
Subaru: “...”
Why won't she answer?
Ugh.
Come on.
No matter how many times I press the button, she won't answer.
She already responded once, so she can't possibly pretend she isn't home!
Subaru: “Is she seriously a shut-in?”
At a loss, I click my tongue gently.
