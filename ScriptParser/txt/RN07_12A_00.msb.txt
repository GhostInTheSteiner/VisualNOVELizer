Kaito: “Uurggh, uuurggh.”
Frau's arm constricts around my neck.
Frau: “Haaah, haaah.”
I can't breathe.
My neck is being crushed.
My consciousness fades.
Frau: “I-I'm pressing them against you. Right up on you...”
I can only barely hear Frau's voice.
My breathing stops.
At this rate I'll really die...
I squeeze out the last bit of strength I have left in order to tap Frau's arm around my neck.
Kaito: “Enough, enough...”
Frau immediately loosens the sleeper hold.
Kaito: “Bwagh, Hahh, Hahh...”
I desperately gasp for air.
Clearly Frau was putting her all into the hold, as she too is out of breath.
Frau: “H-How'd it feel getting ch-choked out by a girl?”
Kaito: “I-I thought I was gonna die...”
Still no attack.
I spread my body across the floor in an attempt to catch my breath.
My whole body feels heavy.
I can tell that the bomb is there inside of my chest.
But no matter how much I abuse myself, the fuse stays unlit.
This is actually my first time trying to force it to happen.
Am I going about this the wrong way?
I glance at the clock and discover that it's almost noon.
I literally just spent the entire night torturing myself.
What kind of punishment is this?
I went for a 30 minute jog in the middle of the night, the creepy red aurora illuminating the sky.
I copied (?) Frau and took an ice cold bath.
Sit ups, push ups...
I might as well be a samurai at this point.
Despite still being out of breath, I raise my body and challenge Takasob yet again.
