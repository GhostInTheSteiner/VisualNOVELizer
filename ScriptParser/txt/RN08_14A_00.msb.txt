Airi's guidance is a total mess.
I was speeding along on my scooter when she told me I was going too fast.
So, now we have to go on foot.
I have no idea how far I'm going, or in what direction.
All I can do is follow Airi as she skips along leisurely.
Airi is just an AR being, so she doesn't get tired no matter how far she walks.
But I have an actual body. I can only walk so much.
Plus I've been pushing my scooter this whole time, so it's twice as tiring. We start at Otatsu Metatsu Rocks.
Airi heads toward the mountains—the direction of the new airport—then heads down Road 76 toward Nishinoomote-shi.
It's a long and steep hill road. Walking up, then slowly descending gets me pretty exhausted.
Midway, we come upon an unpaved mountain road.
Is Kimijima Kou's house really past here?
I can't trust Airi because she's bugging out.
That said, she shows no hesitation in her step.
It's been nearly two hours of walking now.
If the punchline after all this is “I took the wrong road,” I might actually die.
Airi: “The weather tonight for Tanegashima and Yakushima, Kagoshima Prefecture, will be clear♪”
Airi: “Chance of precipitation: 0%♪”
Airi: “The weather tomorrow will be clear♪”
Airi: “Chance of precipitation: 0%♪”
Airi: “Air temperature: high of 10 degrees Celsius, low of 8 degrees Celsius♪”
Airi repeats the weather forecast out loud innocently.
I've heard it a grand total of ten times since we started walking.
Hell, I even have it memorized now.
That's right, clear weather tonight through tomorrow, with a 0% chance of precipitation.
Doesn't look like it'll be snowing.
No matter how many times you check the weather, it won't suddenly turn from a clear day to snowy one.
And even if it did somehow snow tomorrow, making it a white Christmas...
Airi would never be able to see it herself.
