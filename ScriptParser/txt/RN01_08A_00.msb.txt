Kaito: “...”
After school, I plant myself firmly in the empty classroom and munch on some bread while diving deep into KB.
Akiho went off with Mitchie somewhere and hasn't come back.
During our afternoon classes, she seemed to be not really all there. I hope she's okay.
As the only other member of the Robotics Club, I should really be there for Akiho, but...
In truth, I don't actually want to help. Whoops.
This is clearly a trap laid by the VP. We have no way of coming out on top in this, so my efforts would be wasted.
Kaito: “Mm...”
Between matches, I stretch out and cast my gaze out the window.
Huge raindrops fall from the sky relentlessly.
Kaito: “What's my next move...?”
I'm certain Akiho isn't just going to take this sitting down, so I need to come up with a plan of my own.
But either way, my number one priority is to keep Akiho from pushing herself too hard.
Kaito: “...”
Kaito: “I should go before it really turns into a downpour.”
At the end of the day, it's common for people to keep putting off the problems that are right in front of them.
