Numbers appear on my PokeCom screen.
Each second, it counts down closer to zero.
“Countdown Until Solar Storm Arrives”
That's the site name.
Enthusiasts around the world are freely cooperating to gather and manage information.
The people participating are rather skilled. They accurately predicted the magnetic storm in America the other day.
According to the site, the one in America was just the beginning. A bigger one will soon hit the world.
They estimate that'll happen about two and a half months from now.
That'd be in November.
Where are the site managers obtaining such precise information from?
Could it be NASA?
Sawada: “I don't like it.”
I scoff and prepare to remove the countdown from the monitor.
Suddenly, my PokeCom notifies me of an incoming call.
As soon as I answer, video chat boots up.
Sawada: “Yes?”
Misaki: “It's Senomiya.”
Senomiya, currently on a work trip to the Aichi Prefecture factory, appears on screen.
However, behind her is not the factory, but the inside of her car.
Sawada: “What is it?”
Misaki: “Have you seen the news?”
Sawada: “No.”
Misaki: “It's been leaked online.”
Sawada: “Leaked? Do you mean KAMINAGI?”
Misaki: “No.”
Misaki: “Gunvarrel's final episode.”
Sawada: “...”
The moment I understand the meaning of those words, I'm hit by an intense urge to click my tongue.
Sawada: “Now, of all times?”
Misaki: “Like a ghost from four years in the past, you might say.”
Sawada: “I didn't peg you as one for jokes.”
Misaki: “As far as identifying the leaker is concerned, I've made arrangements for an investigation.”
Sawada: “I'll look into it as well.”
Misaki: “I'm returning to Tokyo now.”
Sawada: “Please do.”
I hang up and lean back deep into my chair.
I stare up at the dull fluorescent light on the ceiling.
Sawada: “The timing is too perfect.”
Sawada: “Who's pulling the strings...?”
