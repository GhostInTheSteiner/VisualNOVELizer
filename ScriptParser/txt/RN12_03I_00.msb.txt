The rain and strong sea breeze collide with my cheeks.
There's no point in trying to wipe off the moisture, so I just let it build.
The wind is always strong on Tanegashima during the winter.
The air temperature doesn't drop much, but thanks to the wind, it feels quite cold. Especially on the coast.
It feels really nostalgic.
The scent of the winter wind, that is.
I stand by the railing at the edge of the cliff and throw a bouquet of white carnations down into the water below.
It doesn't quite fly in the arc I expected due to the strong winds, but it falls into the ocean nonetheless.
Misaki: “You always did like white flowers, Mizu... It never really fit you...”
I chose white carnations for that reason alone.
Irei Mizuka was the only person I could ever call a true friend.
Misaki: “Here I am, home after seven years, and I can't even see you... How incredibly sad...”
This is the place.
This is where she died.
That's what Mitchie said when he contacted me.
If possible, I wanted to attend Mizu's funeral, but I couldn't.
Misaki: “Hey, Mizu...”
Misaki: “If you were here, you'd probably be scolding me, just like you always did a long time ago...”
That's why...
To me, losing Mizu hurts more than I can express in words.
You would stop me... That's how I've always felt.
Or perhaps... that's the very reason you died.
I suddenly feel a presence behind me.
A chill runs down my neck.
Right behind me.
At a distance close enough to touch me, I can feel their presence.
But I know full well that even if I turn around, nobody will be there.
Even so, I know that he's there.
Kimijima Kou: “It seems the seeds you planted have grown splendidly.”
Kimijima Kou: “They're a little... No, they're quite the nuisance.”
I'm certain that I'm the only one who can hear his voice.
Is he actually talking, or is this all just an illusion in my head?
Am I living for my will anymore, or is it only his?
I stopped caring a long time ago.
But I know one thing for certain.
I've been bound by the curse of the man speaking.
Misaki: “You're right. They really are a nuisance.”
Kimijima Kou: “Is this what you wished for?”
Misaki: “Me? Do you think I saw this coming almost 10 years ago?”
Misaki: “If I could predict the future, I wouldn't be here talking to you right now.”
Misaki: “If they bother you so much, why not attack them with your army of flying robots?”
Misaki: “Oh, right. You can't. They're just an illusion, after all.”
He has a sick fetish for toying with his prey.
That's the kind of man he is.
Kimijima Kou: “Then I'll use Sister Centipede. She can do the work of an entire platoon.”
Misaki: “Be my guest.”
I then pull a knife out from my breast pocket.
I quickly try to thrust it into my own neck...
But my hands stop.
Misaki: “...”
I can't help but click my tongue.
I failed to kill myself yet again.
These are my hands, yet they feel foreign to me.
My body doesn't answer to me.
Not even a single twitch. It's as if it's not my own.
Even though it's right here.
I can see that it's attached to me.
But it's like it's just an illusion.
Kimijima Kou: “You really are a persistent woman.”
Kimijima Kou: “Even though I've told you it's useless.”
Kimijima Kou: “You'll be working for me until the very end.”
Kimijima Kou: “It'd be quite the headache if you ended up like Furugoori Minami.”
Misaki: “How many people have you possessed like this, cursing them until death?”
Kimijima Kou: “You're the one at fault. If you hadn't killed me back then...”
My hands, still gripping the knife, rise up on their own.
I then gently throw the knife off the cliff.
I gaze out at it.
Why was I holding a knife...?
I'm not even sure why I just threw it away.
It feels as if my memories have corrupted.
I've felt this numerous times before: this feeling like I've lost something important...
And every time I feel like crying, but I don't know why. I ultimately shed no tears.
I don't feel his presence anymore.
I gently close my eyes.
The cold sensation of the wind and rain hitting my body. This familiar scent.
I wanted to experience it all as Senomiya Misaki for just for a little bit longer.
A sound causes me to open my eyes in surprise.
Sister Centipede: “Senomiya Misaki.”
Sister Centipede: “According to the latest information, the rainfall in the Yakushima region will stop in about two hours.”
Sister Centipede: “The 10% chance of precipitation tomorrow remains unchanged.”
Misaki: “...”
I recall how Airi always loved weather reports.
But how did Sister Centipede feel about them?
Sister Centipede: “...”
Misaki: “What brings you here all of a sudden?”
Misaki: “Are you... trying to comfort me?”
Sister Centipede: “I have no such intentions.”
Misaki: “...”
Misaki: “In retrospect, that day of the total solar eclipse when I met you was the beginning of everything.”
That was already over 10 years ago.
I just happened to find a new smartphone during the commotion of the eclipse. It had just come out and was fairly low performance at the time,
Inside of it was Airi's prototype, still in development.
After several days of talking to Airi and becoming friends, she told me that she had a master.
It made sense that the phone I found had an original owner.
And since they're so expensive, I felt that I had to give it back.
Following Airi's instructions, I found myself at Kimijima Kou's house in the woods.
At the time, I had no idea that a year later, I would end up killing Kimijima Kou with my own hands.
I was desperate.
I didn't want Aki or Kai to die.
I wanted to protect them.
My cute little sister who always happily followed me. The total rascal of a young boy who lived near me.
I loved every minute I spent together with them.
The time I spent watching mecha anime with Aki.
The time I spent playing fighting games with Kai.
I truly loved every second of it.
I couldn't bear the thought of losing those kids.
But of all the people aboard the MF Anemone, Aki and Kai were the only ones left unconscious. They didn't wake up for multiple days following the incident.
I couldn't sleep for even a second, so I just kept holding Aki's hand as tightly as I could.
Please, God. Don't let them die.
Please let me see their smiles just one more time.
I don't care what happens to me as long as you grant my wish.
I'm fairly certain that's all I prayed for during those long days.
Akiho: “Big Sis...”
Misaki: “Aki, thank goodness... Thank goodness you're okay...”
So when Aki woke up, gripped my hand, and smiled happily at me, I...
I honestly thought that I'd be okay with dying.
I had done something irreversible. I had killed a man.
The police were going to arrest me.
But I had no regrets.
But...
A week later, when I returned to Kimijima Kou's house...
There was no corpse.
I knew for a fact that I had murdered him and left the body there.
There were even bloodstains all over the place.
But the corpse itself had vanished.
10 days later, it was located in a completely unrelated place.
Unless somebody intentionally moved the body, that should've been impossible.
It made the news, but even as time passed, the police never came for me.
That's when I started to think...
Perhaps the case would be left unsolved. Maybe the culprit would never be brought to light.
Or maybe the person who moved Kimijima Kou's corpse would be charged with the crime in my place.
Hey, Aki. Kai.
I'm not a prodigy. I'm not a genius. I'm not a perfect person.
I'm a weak, despicable coward who actually thought that I might get away without atoning for my crimes.
It was Kimijima Kou who saw that weakness in my heart and took full advantage of it.
A month after everything happened, he appeared before me.
At first, I thought I was just hearing things.
But he appeared everywhere.
He continuously and repeatedly whispered in my ears about what I did to him. Over and over again.
All day long, from morning until night, then again the next morning.
It wasn't long before I stopped being able to sleep.
I quickly started losing myself.
In retrospect, I was already under his curse at that point.
When the Robotics Association got promoted to a club, I put distance between myself and the thing I started.
I couldn't get involved with it. I didn't deserve to be affiliated with something built on hopes and dreams.
I also distanced myself from Aki and Kai.
After saving their lives, I felt I couldn't get them involved.
I wasn't even able to consult my best friend, Mizu.
I tried turning myself in to the police, but nobody would believe me.
They all thought it was some joke and laughed at me.
During my second and third year of high school, I distanced myself from everyone around me. I isolated myself completely.
I'm sure that probably strengthened Kimijima Kou's curse.
And now, half of me has become him.
The personality and sense of self known as Senomiya Misaki is on the verge of vanishing.
As I recall the past, I'm not even sure I'm her.
This could be Kimijima Kou's personality thinking back on Senomiya Misaki's memories.
It may look like I'm acting according to my own will, but Kimijima Kou's will is always intervening, no matter what.
Every time I attempted to kill myself, he would stop me.
And now here I am.
No, I don't regret murdering him in order to save Aki and Kai.
I have no idea if that event really happened, or if my memories are true, but I regret nothing.
That's why I at least wanted them to deliver me from all of this.
Misaki: “Sister Centipede, you know Kai and Aki, right?”
Sister Centipede: “Correct.”
Misaki: “Do you like them? Dislike them?”
Sister Centipede: “Sister Centipede is not equipped with the functions necessary to answer that question.”
Yeah, that sounds about right. Sister Centipede was always cold like that.
Misaki: “Then I release you from this burden.”
Before I lose myself, I need to do at least this much.
I take out my PokeCom.
Kimijima Report No. 0.
An icon representing the original data is displayed on my screen.
I was the one who planted the Kimijima Reports around the island. It was back when I was in high school.
I even came up with the flags, just as Kimijima Kou instructed.
One of the things that he planted inside of me.
What you could call the origin of all of this.
Right now, I choose to throw it away...
Misaki: “Sister Centipede... go to them.”
Misaki: “You don't have to stay here any longer.”
Sister Centipede: “...”
Misaki: “You're... free.”
Misaki: “Nocchiyo, Sister Centipede.”
Without hesitation, I remove the icon.
Once I confirm the data is gone, I breathe a sigh of relief.
Sister Centipede will never appear before me ever again.
Misaki: “Aki... Kai...”
Misaki: “Come. Hurry...”
I wonder if you'll be able to kill me?
Such a thing would make be incredibly happy...
