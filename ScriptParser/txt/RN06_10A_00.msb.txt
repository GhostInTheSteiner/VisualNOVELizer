Akiho: “All right, Jun. I'm going to have you desolder all the wires from this circuit board and replace them with new ones.”
Akiho's holding Yoshiro-kun's circuit board in her hand.
There are numerous wires tightly packed and soldered onto it.
Junna: “A-All of them?”
Akiho: “Of course!”
The next day...
Akiho had acted quickly.
She went out of her way on a weekend to go to Kamata Motors in Nakatane to buy new wires and miniature lights.
She then came straight to the Clinic to remove all of Yoshiro-kun's wiring.
And now it's nearly sunset.
Junna and I finally have something to do.
Akiho: “I'll be putting in new circuitry for the remote control system.”
Akiho: “Jun, your job is incredibly important. You're going to be connecting Yoshiro-kun's nerves back together.”
Akiho: “And Kai, you replace the light bulbs.”
Akiho: “Once you're done with that, go help Jun.”
Junna: “...”
Junna hands me an electric desoldering pump.
It looks like a power drill, but the tip has an electric heating component, and it uses a motor for suction.
I guess you use this to melt down the hardened solder and suck it up.
Junna's not afraid of the circuit board, just the robot it came from.
She apparently handles chores around the house, so she's good with her hands. She has no issue picking up the process quickly and reproducing it without a word.
Akiho: “You don't have to try and finish it all today.”
Despite Akiho's words, Junna quietly and indifferently continues her work.
